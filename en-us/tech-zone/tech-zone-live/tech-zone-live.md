[![Tech Zone Live Banner](/en-us/tech-zone/media/tech-zone-live_tech-zone-live_banner.png)](https://www.citrix.com/events/2021/tech-zone-live.html)

Tech Zone Live returns on July 28, 2021, so now's the time to [register](https://www.citrix.com/events/2021/tech-zone-live.html).

The Tech Zone Live event has something for everyone.  We've broken down the next event into two main topics:

1.  Moving to the cloud to adapt a hybrid work environment
2.  Protecting your company from ransomware attacks

In each hour long segment, we break it down into three distinct sub-sessions covering different aspects

In Technical Session 1, **Moving to the cloud to adapt to a hybrid work environment**, we will:

*  Show you why moving to Citrix Workspace is right for you.
*  Debunk any cloud myths that have stopped you from adopting a hybrid, flexible work environment.
*  Learn how you can use Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop service as a business continuity solution to scale up and down when needed.

In Technical Session 2, **Protecting your company from ransomware attacks**, we will:

*  Talk about what is ransomware, why you should care, and what you can do about it.
*  Discuss some of the tools you can use to proactively protect your environment from ransomware attacks.
*  Explain how to securely deliver SaaS & web applications and let your users browse the internet without exposing your data to attackers.
