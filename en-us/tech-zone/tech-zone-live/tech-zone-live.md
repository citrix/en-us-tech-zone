# Tech Zone Live

[![Tech Zone Live Banner](/en-us/tech-zone/media/tech-zone-live_banner.png)](https://www.citrix.com/events/2021/tech-zone-live.html)

Tech Zone Live returns on May 19, 2021, so now's the time to register [here](https://www.citrix.com/events/2021/tech-zone-live.html).

The Tech Zone Live event has something for everyone.  We've broken down the next event into three main topics

1.  Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)
2.  Desktops-as-a-Service (DaaS)
3.  Windows Virtual Desktops (WVD)

In each hour long segment, we break it down into three distinct levels of knowledge

*  Level 1 = Intro: Here we will provide you with a baseline understanding of the tech.
*  Level 2 = Deep Dive: For those who are looking to expand their knowledge even further.
*  Level 3 = Case Study: Tech is cool, but where do I use it?  Here we will provide you with real examples/tips.

Join us on May 19, 2021 at [Tech Zone Live](https://www.citrix.com/events/2021/tech-zone-live.html)
