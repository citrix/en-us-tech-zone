# Communication Ports Used by Citrix Technologies

This article provides an overview of common ports that are used by Citrix components and must be considered as part of networking architecture, especially if communication traffic traverses network components such as firewalls or proxy servers where ports must be opened to ensure communication flow.

Not all ports need to be open, depending on your deployment and requirements.

## Citrix Cloud

The only Citrix component needed to serve as a channel for communication between Citrix Cloud and your resource locations is Citrix Cloud Connector. All connections are established from the Cloud Connector to the cloud using the standard HTTPS port (443) and the TCP protocol. No incoming connections are accepted.

Host management and Machine Creation Management capabilities of Citrix Cloud also require TCP 9350–9354 opened for communications to the Citrix-managed control plane.

Cloud Connectors must be able to connect to Digicert for certificate revocation checks.

### Citrix Cloud - Gateway Service

By default, the Gateway Service will proxy HDX connections via the Citrix Cloud Connectors, however Rendezvous Protocol changes the flow of HDX connections in an attempt to directly connect the VDA to the Gateway Service bypassing the Citrix Cloud Connectors

#### Rendezvous Protocol and HDX Enlightened Data Transport Protocol (EDT)

| Source | Destination     | Type | Port | Details                             |
| ------ | --------------- | ---- | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| VDA    | Gateway Service | UDP  | 443  | EDT UDP over 443 to Gateway Service |

The VDAs must have access to `https://*.nssvc.net`, including all subdomains. Or `https://*.c.nssvc.net` and `https://*.g.nssvc.net`.

  >**Note:**
  >
  >If using EDT in Microsoft Azure, UDP must be defined on the Citrix Gateway protecting the VDA

Use the following information for configuration of firewalls when you place StoreFront in its own network:

1.  Locate the config files:
    -  `C:\Program Files\Citrix\Receiver StoreFront\Services\SubscriptionsStoreService\Citrix.DeliveryServices.SubscriptionsStore.ServiceHost.exe.config`
    -  `C:\Program Files\Citrix\Receiver StoreFront\Services\CredentialWallet\Citrix.DeliveryServices.CredentialWallet.ServiceHost.exe.config`
1.  Edit both the config files changing the values for endpoint URIs.

    For example - `<endpoint uri="net.p2p://CitrixCredentialWalletReplication">` so any address that starts with `net.p2p://` includes the port. You should end up with `<endpoint uri="net.p2p://CitrixCredentialWalletReplication:93”>` and `<endpoint uri="net.p2p://Citrix-Subscriptions-1__Citrix_Store">` becomes `<endpoint uri="net.p2p://Citrix-Subscriptions-1__Citrix_Store:93">` and so on for all other net.p2p addresses.

1.  Restart the subscriptions store and credential wallet.
1.  The local firewall includes rules for allowing per application access, so it is not locked down by port.
