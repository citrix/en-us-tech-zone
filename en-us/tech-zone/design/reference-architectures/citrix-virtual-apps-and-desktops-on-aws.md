### Audience and Objective

This document is intended to help existing and prospective Citrix
partners and customers analyze and understand the most critical design
decisions necessary to successfully deploy Citrix virtualization
technologies on Amazon’s public cloud. It is not meant to be a “How-To”
reference - Citrix considers those [Deployment Guides](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/build/deployment-guides.html),
and they are now delivered and maintained separately from
[Reference Architectures](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/design/reference-architectures.html).
In this document we will be leveraging the Citrix Architectural Design
Framework to organize and present the leading practices,
recommendations, and design patterns used by Citrix and select Citrix
consulting partners.

## Overview and Executive Summary

Citrix virtualization and networking technologies are very comprehensive
and mature, having successfully served the needs of enterprises large
and small for nearly three decades. There are many ways in which
Citrix’s virtualization and networking technologies can be licensed,
deployed, integrated, and managed in order to meet a broad variety of
use cases, business types, integration requirements, and operational
models. This paper has been written for the Citrix customer/partner
who’s considering or planning to deploy these technologies on AWS’
public cloud infrastructure.

For both existing customers looking to modernize their infrastructure or
new customers looking to deploy Citrix virtualization and networking
technologies, there are a number of key high and low level decisions
which need to be made along the way to help facilitate a successful
deployment. In order to help customers and partners understand these
decision points, we have introduced and/or defined some specific
terminology to set the appropriate context, then used this context to
highlight the critical decisions and implications you’ll want to
consider as you’re planning your deployment.

We start by defining two primary technology adoption models:
**Customer Managed** and **Cloud Services**. We
then break the **components of a Citrix virtualization system**
down into multiple subsystems, and categorize them by adoption model:

| Adoption Model / Subsystem function | Customer Managed (installed from downloaded binaries) | Cloud Service (delivered via Citrix Cloud) |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Session brokering and administration** | Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (**CVAD**) | Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service (**CVADS**) |
| **User interface (UI) services** | Citrix StoreFront | Citrix Workspace (the service, consumed via Citrix Workspace app or web browser) |
| **Authentication** | Citrix StoreFront (plus Citrix ADC/Gateway for most use cases) | Citrix Workspace (plus Citrix ADC/Gateway for certain use cases) |
| **HDX session proxy** | Citrix ADC/Gateway | Citrix Gateway Service |

We take a stand for **cloud services**, recommending that **most
organizations leverage or plan to leverage cloud services** where
feasible. We don’t offer this stand blindly - while we do believe cloud
services, in the long run, offer overwhelmingly positive benefits for
our customers, we recognize that **not all organizations/deployments
will be able to leverage cloud services for all subsystems today**. In
some cases, use case requirements (in combination with technical
attributes and/or shortcomings in a currently available/specific cloud
service) will necessitate adopting a combination of cloud services and
customer managed component: we focus on these in this paper. In other
cases, non-technical items (politics, budgetary/contractual
considerations, cloud readiness deficiencies, regulatory/compliance
considerations, etc.) may discourage the usage of cloud services. In
these instances, we recommend working with your Citrix
partner/sales/engineering team to help overcome them. Through the rest
of this paper, we go to great lengths to identify key capabilities,
features, or attributes that will help customers decide which adoption
model to use for which subsystem and when.

Next, we define and examine three common deployment scenarios,
highlighting which adoption model is used for each subsystem:

-  **Greenfield**/**Cloud only** - leverages cloud services for all
    Citrix virtualization system subsystems, plus AWS public cloud
    services.
-  **Hybrid** (not to be confused with a ‘hybrid cloud’) - the most
    common deployment model, the hybrid model uses CVADS for session
    brokering and administration, with both customer managed and cloud
    service options for the remaining subsystems.
-  **Lift and Shift** - as the name states, this model leverages
    existing, customer managed CVAD, StoreFront, and ADC/Gateway and
    either migrates these components to AWS as is, or installs them into
    AWS as part of a workload migration to AWS public cloud services.
    While this is a valid deployment model for certain specific use
    cases, it comes with substantial caveats.

Finally, we leverage the well documented **Citrix Architectural Design Framework** to
organize and present the key design decisions to be considered when
deploying Citrix virtualization technology on AWS. We keep our focus on
“what’s different about Citrix on AWS” for clarity, providing links to
other resources for more detailed information as needed.

We ultimately recommend that most customers leverage the
**Hybrid deployment model** from day one, using the CVAD service
for **session brokering and
administration**. This
provides the customer with key capabilities necessary to cost
effectively run a Citrix virtualization system on AWS, substantially
reduces the cost and complexity, provides access to the latest features
and capabilities available, and simplifies the migration to and usage of
other cloud services in the future. Either cloud services OR customer
managed components can be leveraged for the remaining subsystems
(depending upon the customers’ specific needs), though we recommend
customers are clear as to why they’re using customer managed components
and have a plan to move to cloud services in the future once the cloud
services meet their specific needs.

## Key Concepts and Deployment Scenarios

In this section, we’ll describe some key concepts and deployment
scenarios before we dive into specific considerations for each layer of
the **Citrix Architectural Design Framework**.

### Technology Adoption Models

Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops technology can be ‘consumed’ or
implemented a variety of different ways. The most common methods can be
described generally as **Customer Managed** and **Cloud Services**. A
third model is also worth mentioning - **Partner Managed**. We’ll
describe this model here for clarity, but from an architectural design
perspective, the first two are the most relevant.

Why are we discussing technology adoption models in a reference
architecture? The choice of adoption or ‘consumption’ model has a
substantial impact upon the system design, capabilities, cost, and
delineation of management responsibilities. This section will define and
explore these models, as well as provide some general guidance to help
customers make informed choices as they design a Citrix virtualization
system.

#### Customer Managed

For many years, businesses wanting to consume technology had no choice
but to buy, install, configure, and maintain the entire technology stack
required to build a Citrix virtualization system. Citrix’s
virtualization software was only available as installable binaries.
Customers who bought Citrix’s virtualization software would download
these binaries (often in the form of a downloadable ISO disk image or
self-extracting executables) then install, configure, and maintain the
software themselves. The Citrix software (and networking hardware) was
most commonly installed into/on infrastructure the customer owned and
maintained, in data centers they also owned and maintained.

Conceptually speaking, a Citrix virtualization system is made up of a
number of different Citrix components (many of which we’ll describe in
detail in this paper) and a number of different layers of third-party
components which need to be provided before you can do anything with the
Citrix bits. Ultimately, they all come together to create a functional
Citrix virtualization system. For the sake of clarity, this document
will refer to this technology adoption model as **“Customer Managed”**.
We will use this term to describe a variety of different components in a
Citrix virtualization system, as well as the requisite third party
components in the layers underneath, next to, and ‘above’ the Citrix
components. This model could also be called “Self-Managed”.

Today, customers have very compelling alternatives to a customer managed
adoption model, yet some still adopt elements of their technology stack
using this model for a variety of different reasons. While this model
provides customers with the **most control over each component**, it
comes at a cost: the customer takes on the responsibility to manage and
maintain the component, including securing, operating, patching,
upgrading, and maintaining high availability. This model is also
**commonly deployed for ‘air gapped’ systems** (those without any
Internet access, and hence are limited in their ability to leverage
cloud services, which are commonly and securely accessed over public
networks).

Here’s an example of the architecture of a Citrix virtualization system
that’s using 100% customer managed components deployed on AWS using
basic AWS IaaS services such as EC2 and VPC networking. We’ll be
discussing some of the details of this architecture in later sections of
this document, though you may immediately notice the similarities to the
much simpler greenfield/cloud only deployment model:

![Diagram 1: 100% Customer Managed, Lift/Shift deployment using AWS as IaaS only](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_001.png)
*Diagram 1: 100% Customer Managed, Lift/Shift deployment using AWS as IaaS only.*

#### Cloud Services

Over the last 15 years, technological advancements across many different
fields have given rise to hyper scale public clouds, sophisticated cloud
services, microservice architectures, DevOPS/Agile delivery frameworks,
subscription licensing models, and ‘evergreen’ software and systems.
These advancements have revolutionized the way technology is acquired,
adopted, delivered and maintained across almost every industry in the
world.

Today, many of the components and/or layers that comprise a Citrix
virtualization system are available “as a Service”. In contrast to the
Customer Managed adoption model (where customers buy technology as a
corporate asset and build/maintain systems themselves), customers
“subscribe” to various services, and the service provider takes on
some or all of the responsibility for delivering and managing these
services. These services are often consumed over public networks (ie the
Internet) leading some to call this a “Cloud Service” or “Web Service”
adoption model. For the purpose of this paper we’re going to refer to
this type of adoption model as “Cloud Managed Services”, or simply the
**“Cloud Service(s)”** model.

Citrix offers many of its traditional products ‘as a Service’,
leveraging its platform partners’ latest technological advancements to
simplify and streamline adoption, accelerate the pace of innovation,
improve quality, and deliver additional incremental value to their
customers over time. Citrix calls this service delivery platform “Citrix
Cloud”, and it represents the current and future state of the art from
Citrix.

Here’s an example of the architecture of a system that’s using 100%
cloud service components for a Citrix virtualization system on AWS.
We’ll be discussing the details of this design in a later section of
this document:

![Diagram 2: 100% Cloud Services on AWS with AWS Managed Services](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_002.png)
*Diagram 2: 100% Cloud Services on AWS with AWS Managed Services*

#### Partner Managed

While many organizations choose to buy technology or subscribe to cloud
services they can use to build their own Citrix virtualization system,
some customers seek to get out of the business of managing IT as much as
possible to focus resources and attention on serving their own customers
and markets. In order to serve this segment of the market, Citrix works
with a variety of integration partners who leverage Citrix technologies
to provide more of a ‘finished goods’ service to their customers.

Defining and differentiating the different integration partners/types
and offerings available are outside of the scope of this document, but
it is important to note that Citrix partners face the same choices
customers face when it comes to designing a Citrix virtualization
system. The Citrix partner may choose to leverage one or more services
from Citrix Cloud, or they may choose to manage some components of the
system on behalf of their own customers and their specific needs. As
such, the guidance provided in this document will be relevant to both
the Citrix partner and their customers, just for different reasons.

### Citrix Virtualization System Components

In order to understand the implications of the design decisions we’ll
detail later in this document, we’re going to put the components of a
Citrix virtualization system into higher level ‘buckets’ we’ll then use
to guide your decision-making process. Every Citrix virtualization
system, regardless of how it is deployed and/or licensed, needs these
components available in order to function and provide the best, most
secure user experience. It is not uncommon for customers to mix and
match self-managed components and cloud services, especially if they’ve
got complex use case requirements, third party integration requirements,
and/or extreme control or availability needs.

The table below highlights some of these key components here for
clarity. Details and recommendations on when/where you’d use one option
vs another will be covered later in this document:

| Adoption Model / Subsystem function | Customer Managed (installed from downloaded binaries) | Cloud Service (delivered via Citrix Cloud) |
|---|---|---|
|**Session brokering and administration** - The core of any Citrix virtualization system: without this core subsystem, you don’t have any apps or desktops, and you can’t manage them! This subsystem is where you define, provision, and update Machine Catalogs (collections of “Virtual Delivery Agent” or “VDA” VM instances). It is also where you create Delivery Groups, assigning apps/desktops to users, as well as administer the environment and user sessions. | **CVAD - Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops**, either Long term service release (LTSR) or Current Release (CR). If you install/configure a “Delivery Controller” in your environment, this is what you’re running. It also means you’re installing and managing your own Microsoft SQL Server infrastructure. Administrative functions in a customer managed (CVAD) deployment include Citrix Director and Citrix Studio. You install, configure, and manage these yourself using LTSR/CR binaries. Director also requires Microsoft SQL Server infrastructure. Citrix licensing is also a part of this subsystem, with customers installing/configuring/ managing Citrix license servers and license files. | **CVADS - Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service**, delivered via Citrix Cloud. If you’re logging into Citrix Cloud and installing/registering “Cloud Connectors” in your environment, you’re using this Citrix Cloud service. You install and register Cloud Connectors on Windows instances you manage, and then Citrix keeps them evergreen and available. Citrix Cloud also provides and maintains most administrative functionality via web browser through the Citrix Cloud console. This includes cloud service versions of Citrix Studio and Citrix Director. There is no additional infrastructure for the customer to maintain, keep highly available, or patch/update: Citrix owns this administrative responsibility. |
|**UI (user interface) services** - Native Citrix Workspace apps (and web browsers for clientless access) ultimately connect to a URL. The subsystem behind the URL is configured by IT administrators to match corporate requirements for authentication, and to present virtualized apps/desktops, SaaS apps, and possibly much more for users to access. | **Citrix Storefront**. Also installed/ configured from CVAD LTSR or CR binaries, this role provides extreme flexibility for the most complex deployment scenarios. Typically deployed in pairs, with Citrix ADC/Gateway instances in front of them for high availability. Can aggregate and present apps and desktops from both customer managed/brokered environments (CVAD) and Citrix Cloud managed/brokered environments (CVADS). | **Citrix Workspace** (the service, not the Citrix Workspace app). Provided as a cloud service through Citrix Cloud, and includes a lot of next generation capabilities that can only be leveraged through this service. Can aggregate and present apps and desktops from both customer managed/brokered environments (CVAD) and Citrix Cloud managed/brokered environments (CVADS). |
| **Authentication** - In this context, we’re referring to how users authenticate prior to accessing Citrix virtualized apps/desktops, files, SaaS apps, and more. Authentication in a Citrix environment is typically configured at the UI services layer, though Citrix ADC/Gateway can also play a big authentication role in all deployment models. Each of the UI service provider options (Citrix StoreFront or Citrix Workspace) have different authentication options available, some requiring a customer managed Citrix ADC/Gateway. | **Citrix StoreFront** (plus **Citrix ADC/Gateway** for most use cases). User authentication services can be provided a number of different ways, though ultimately require an Active Directory instance and valid user accounts. The customer manages the AD instance in most cases. Citrix ADC/Gateway instances can also play a big role in providing authentication services, and also provide a ton of advanced capabilities that are commonly leveraged for more complex environments. Citrix Federated Authentication Services (FAS) can also be installed and used to provide session SSO for complex use cases. | **Citrix Workspace** (plus **Citrix ADC/Gateway** for certain use cases). With Citrix Workspace (the service), user authentication sources and requirements are configured once for the Citrix Cloud tenant and leveraged by all users using this URL. It is configured for Active Directory out of the box, but for advanced use cases, can also be configured to support other authentication providers (Azure AD, Okta, customer managed Citrix Gateway, Google Cloud ID, or other SAML/OpenID/RADIUS providers). Some scenarios require customer managed Citrix ADC/Gateways and/or Citrix Federated Authentication Services (FAS) for the best user experience. |
|**HDX session proxy** | **Citrix ADC/Gateway** appliances (virtual or physical) - these appliances provide a ton of additional functionality for a Citrix virtualization system, but their core role is for securely proxying HDX session traffic to your VDA’s when clients are on public networks. Requires installation, configuration, SSL certificates, etc. Works with both StoreFront (customer managed UI services) and Workspace cloud service, as well as both Citrix managed and customer managed session brokering options. | **Citrix Gateway Service** - provided by Citrix Cloud, this service proxies HDX session traffic to your VDA’s as well, and it uses Citrix managed infrastructure to get the job done. Requires no public IP addresses, SSL certs, or ingress firewall rules to operate. Works with the Citrix Workspace cloud service and both Citrix Cloud managed and customer managed session brokering options (CVAD and CVADS). |

#### Leading Practices and Recommendations

Regardless of whether you manage your Citrix virtualization yourselves
or leverage Citrix or an authorized partner to do it, Citrix recommends
customers consider leveraging **cloud services**, from Citrix and
partner service providers such as AWS, wherever possible. For use
cases/environments where the cloud service doesn’t meet the customer’s
needs, customer managed components can be leveraged, though Citrix
encourages customers to be clear on why they are deploying self-managed
components, and be prepared to migrate to cloud services once the cloud
service does meet their specific needs. The cloud services provided by
Citrix through Citrix Cloud are evolving rapidly, and over time you can
expect them to provide all the functionality required to serve all but
the most complex use cases. Leveraging Citrix Cloud services ultimately
minimizes the amount of infrastructure the customer is responsible for
managing and maintaining, provides highly available, pre-integrated
services, and ensures customers always have access to the latest, most
secure and feature rich services.

### Common Deployment Models for Citrix Virtualization on AWS

As a cloud provider with the most functionality, largest community of
customers, unmatched experience and maturity, AWS sees a broad variety
of customers from a broad variety of industries moving systems and
infrastructure to their clouds. Over time they’ve seen common deployment
scenarios/migration patterns develop. In this section, we’ll explore
these patterns/scenarios, discuss when and where you may want to
consider using them to bring a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops workload
to AWS, and provide some recommendations for which patterns to consider
for common migration scenarios.

The three most common scenarios for delivering Citrix Apps and Desktops
on AWS are:

-  **Greenfield/Cloud Only** deployment, leveraging Citrix Cloud
    services with “resource locations” on Amazon EC2 (Amazon Elastic
    Compute Cloud) service. This scenario is commonly used when
    customers prefer to go to a subscription model and outsource control
    plane infrastructure and management responsibility to Citrix, or
    they’re looking to experience/evaluate the capabilities provided by
    Citrix Cloud services.
-  **Hybrid** deployment/workload migration to AWS, leveraging Citrix
    Cloud services for session brokering and administration, Workspace
    UI or StoreFront for content aggregation/session
    presentation/session launching, and may also leverage customer
    managed Citrix ADC/Gateways for HDX session proxying and/or complex
    authentication scenarios.
-  **Lift and shift**. With this scenario, customers essentially move
    or re-deploy their self-managed Citrix infrastructure into AWS,
    treating the deployment on AWS just like their existing customer
    managed deployment. With this scenario, customers use Citrix
    ADC/Gateway and Citrix StoreFront to aggregate resources from
    on-premises and AWS hosted sites while migrating the workloads to
    AWS, or they may keep their on-premises workloads around and simply
    add another site in AWS for new workloads or to support DR/failover
    use cases. This model is characterized by the use of customer
    managed components for session brokering and administration, UI
    services, authentication, and HDX session proxy.

This section will define these scenarios in more detail, including
architectural overviews of how each scenario is commonly designed.
You’ll find that, in most cases, the **leading practice is to leverage
Citrix Cloud services**, and as such this document will focus on the
Citrix Cloud brokered deployment models (“Greenfield” and “Hybrid”
above).

#### Greenfield Deployment

The most common example of the greenfield deployment model is trial or
proof of concept deployments of Citrix virtualization technology on AWS
cloud. Since you’re essentially starting from scratch, the power of
‘infrastructure as code’ can be experienced since you’re not trying to
integrate with a bunch of existing ‘stuff’. It is also a fantastic
opportunity to ‘play with’ a broad variety of cloud services and
evaluate their suitability to your or your customers’ needs.

Consequently, a greenfield deployment is also the quickest and easiest
Citrix virtualization system you can build, and you can simply tear it
down if/when the system is no longer needed and you’re no longer paying
for the resources it consumes. All you need for this type of deployment
is an active AWS account and either a trial or paid subscription to
Citrix Cloud and the Virtual Apps and Desktops Service. Armed with these
two resources, you can leverage AWS’ QuickStart Cloud Formation
templates to build a reference deployment. Citrix and AWS have
collaborated on the [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-virtual-apps/)
QuickStart template, which helps you to either build an entire Citrix
virtualization system from scratch, or create a Citrix Cloud “Resource
Location” in an existing VPC with an existing Active Directory. When
deploying the entire Citrix virtualization system from scratch, the
resulting system on AWS is built closely matching the reference
architecture diagrams below:

![Diagram 3: Deployed system architecture detail using the CVADS on AWS QuickStart template and default parameters. Citrix Cloud Services not shown](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_003.png)

*Diagram 3: Deployed system architecture detail using the CVADS on AWS QuickStart template and default parameters. Citrix Cloud Services not shown.*

![Diagram 4: Greenfield/Cloud Only deployment conceptual architecture with optional AWS services and Citrix Cloud Services](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_004.png)

*Diagram 4: Greenfield/Cloud Only deployment conceptual architecture with optional AWS services and Citrix Cloud Services.*

It is worth noting that this deployment model (actually, all three
deployment models\!) leverages [AWS Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
to provide a highly available design. See
[Availability Zones](#infrastructure-as-code-and-the-aws-object-model) later in
this document for more context.

As mentioned previously, this is a great place to start when learning
about AWS and Citrix Cloud services. Many of the design patterns
depicted in the preceding diagram are used for hybrid and even lift and
shift deployment types, so learning these design patterns will suit a
Citrix on AWS architect well regardless of the deployment model.

To summarize, the **greenfield deployment model** leverages all cloud
services, at least as a starting point:

| [Citrix virtualization system component](#citrix-virtualization-system-components) | Provided by: |
|---|---|
| [Session brokering and administration](#session-brokering-and-administration) | Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service (“CVADS”, via Citrix Cloud) |
| [UI services](#ui-user-interface-services) | Citrix Workspace Service (via Citrix Cloud) |
| [Authentication](#authentication) | Citrix Workspace Service (via Citrix Cloud) |
| [HDX session proxy](#hdx-session-proxy) | Citrix Gateway Service (via Citrix Cloud) |
| VM compute, networking, and storage | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) |
| Active Directory and file systems | [AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and [Amazon’s FSx for Windows File Server](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/) (optional) |

We mentioned earlier that the greenfield deployment model is often used
as a starting point for proof of concept and technology trial systems.
If you start with this model and then drop in StoreFront or Citrix
ADC/Gateway VPX’s in, you’re ostensibly creating our next type of
deployment model: hybrid.

#### Hybrid Deployment

With the hybrid deployment model, customers may choose to
install/configure/manage some of the [Citrix virtualization system components](#citrix-virtualization-system-components) themselves,
**with the exception of the [session brokering and administration](#session-brokering-and-administration)
subsystem**. In a hybrid deployment model, this subsystem is provided as
a cloud service called “Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service” (CVADS
for short), and it is delivered as a subscription from Citrix Cloud.

The hybrid deployment model is the most common deployment seen today,
and is the model Citrix recommends for most customers. Here are some of
the primary reasons why we take this position:

-  **Simplicity** - With Citrix Cloud services, simplicity is a
    foundational design tenet. When multiple cloud services are
    leveraged, they come pre-configured to work together, and when
    configuration is necessary, workflows and options are dramatically
    simplified.
-  **Infrastructure and licensing cost savings** - customer managed
    Citrix virtualization services often require additional hardware and
    software to support them, and these have costs associated with them.
    One good example is Microsoft SQL Server: customer managed brokering
    and administration services require databases, and if you’re going
    to build/manage your own, you need to provide them. (An alternative
    is leveraging the AWS Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) for
    SQL Server).
-  **Autoscaling** - Citrix’s managed brokering service (CVADS)
    includes the [**autoscale feature**](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/autoscale.html),
    which provides built-in VDA capacity and cost management
    functionality. This feature can save customers a substantial amount
    of money on infrastructure when they’re only paying for what they
    use. When running a Citrix virtualization workload on AWS, this
    often means the difference between ponying up for committed use
    discounts and paying for VM usage as you go. The cost savings can be
    dramatic for many use cases, and the Citrix autoscale feature helps
    ensure you’re only consuming what you need.  
    **Important note:** *This feature is only available to Citrix Cloud
    service (i.e. Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service) customers -
    it is not available to customer managed brokering infrastructure
    (i.e. Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops LTSR or CR releases).*
-  **Management savings** - With cloud services, Citrix shoulders the
    responsibility for keeping the services highly available,
    performant, secure, and up to date. You still build and manage your
    VDA’s regardless, but don’t underestimate the value of delegating
    these responsibilities\! Cloud services can go a long way towards
    freeing up IT resources to focus on providing unique value to their
    businesses instead of these critical but tedious and often
    time-consuming tasks.
-  **“Free” upgrades and continuous innovation** - with customer
    managed infrastructure, the onus is on the customer to upgrade and
    patch the components in their care. With Cloud services, most of
    those work efforts go away. The service providers (Citrix or AWS for
    example) tend to be constantly innovating, and they bring those
    innovations to the customers who consume the services, often without
    requiring any work on behalf of the customer.
-  **Access to additional features, functionality, and services -**
    modern service delivery platforms (such as Citrix Cloud and AWS EC2)
    give technology providers a powerful, cost effective way to bring
    new features, capabilities, and services to market that would not
    otherwise be possible. Vendors such as Citrix are committed to
    meeting the customer wherever they are at in their digital
    transformation journey, but sometimes the only way to cost
    effectively deliver new capabilities is to deliver them as a cloud
    service.
-  **Flexibility** - with CVADS as the foundation of this deployment
    model, customers can mix and match customer managed or cloud service
    components of the Citrix virtualization system to meet a broad
    variety of use cases and support complex enterprise requirements for
    a Citrix virtualization system. We’ll explore these choices in depth
    in a later section of this paper.

To summarize, the **hybrid deployment model** leverages the following:

| [Citrix virtualization system component](#citrix-virtualization-system-components) | Provided by: |
|---|---|
| [Session brokering and administration](#session-brokering-and-administration) | Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service (“CVADS”, via Citrix Cloud) |
| [UI services](#ui-user-interface-services) | Citrix Workspace Service (via Citrix Cloud) **OR** Citrix StoreFront on Amazon EC2 (customer managed) |
| [Authentication](#authentication) | Citrix Workspace Service (via Citrix Cloud) **OR** Citrix StoreFront on EC2 (Citrix ADC/Gateway optional but common) |
| [HDX session proxy](#hdx-session-proxy) | Citrix Gateway Service (via Citrix Cloud) **OR** Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on Amazon EC2 (Citrix ADC/Gateway optional but common) |
| VM compute, networking, and storage | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) |
| Active Directory and file systems | [AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and [Amazon’s FSx for Windows File Server](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/) (optional) |

Given the options a customer may choose in the hybrid deployment model,
and the flexibility provided by customer managed components, there isn’t
one, succinct architecture that fits all customers. There are, however,
some common design patterns that can also be mixed/matched to suit the
customers’ needs. The foundational pattern, however, is the pattern for
a Citrix Cloud “Resource Location” on AWS. It is also the pattern built
by the “[Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-virtual-apps/)”
QuickStart template, and it looks similar to the architectural diagram
below:

![Diagram 5: Conceptual Architecture, CVADS - Hybrid Deployment Model on AWS](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_005.png)

*Diagram 5: Conceptual Architecture, CVADS - Hybrid Deployment Model on AWS.*

It is worth noting that this deployment model also leverages
[AWS Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
to provide a highly available design. See
[Availability Zones](#infrastructure-as-code-and-the-aws-object-model) later in
this document for more context.

It is also worth noting that the hybrid deployment model (a CVADS
resource location on AWS) can be combined with a hybrid cloud model,
connecting customer managed data centers/resources to AWS using AWS
Direct Connect, AWS VPN, Citrix SD-WAN, or other networking tools. With
this model, the customers’ existing Active Directory is often extended
into AWS, and customers create additional Citrix Cloud ‘Resource
Locations’ which deliver apps, desktops, and resources from the customer
managed datacenter. The resulting conceptual architecture looks
something like the diagram below:
![Diagram 6: Conceptual Architecture, CVADS: Hybrid Deployment/Hybrid Cloud Model](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_006.png)

*Diagram 6: Conceptual Architecture, CVADS: Hybrid Deployment/Hybrid Cloud Model.*

#### Lift and Shift

Referring back to our definition of the [Citrix
virtualization system
components](#citrix-virtualization-system-components), when we’re
talking about a lift and shift deployment scenario, the key component of
this is the [session brokering and
administration](#session-brokering-and-administration) subsystem
and associated infrastructure. **If you’re using self-managed brokering
infrastructure (i.e. you’re deploying Delivery Controllers instead of
Cloud Connectors) then for the purposes of this paper you’re lifting and
shifting.**

##### Lift and Shift - why

Despite Citrix guidance against this model, some customers will still
choose to go with this model and deploy/manage the Citrix virtualization
system components themselves. For customers who choose the lift and
shift (self-managed) deployment model, we often find that non-technical
reasons are behind it. Politics, time pressures, fear of the unknown,
perceived skills deficits, loss of control, and license acquisition fall
into this category. There are, however, a few technical reasons why this
model is appealing. These include:

-  **System Isolation** - some use cases, such as air-gapped systems
    with no Internet access, often make the lift and shift model
    appealing. Since cloud services require outbound Internet access to
    function, in a strictly air-gapped deployment, cloud services won’t
    function. This mainly applies to the Cloud Connectors (primary
    component of managed session brokering services) as they need
    outbound Internet connectivity to communicate with and utilize the
    Citrix Cloud services. Some customers may consider utilizing a
    secure, outbound proxy for Cloud Connectors (while keeping all other
    infrastructure strictly air-gapped). This is often a suitable
    concession which allows the managed brokering services to be
    utilized, but even this may not be an option for some customers and
    use cases.
-  **Configuration flexibility** - one person’s ‘complex’ is another
    person’s ‘flexible’, and flexibility has been a strong suite of
    customer managed Citrix virtualization infrastructure for more than
    two decades. Over the years the technology has gained a ton of
    features that support some very niche use cases and third-party
    integrations. The Citrix Cloud services focus on simplicity and
    pre-integration first and foremost, and in doing so some of these
    niche features and integrations are not available. As such, some
    edge cases are still best served by a customer managed stack, though
    with the rapid pace of innovation coming to the Citrix Cloud
    services, the edge cases are becoming more and more rare.
-  **Control** - some organizations, cultures, and business models
    demand as much control as possible. With customer managed Citrix
    virtualization components, customers can completely own their
    destiny. This control comes at a cost (infrastructure, complexity,
    manpower, etc.) but “control at all cost” is a thing for some
    customers.

To summarize, the **lift and shift deployment model** leverages the
following:

| [Citrix virtualization system component](#citrix-virtualization-system-components) | Provided by: |
|---|---|
| [Session brokering and administration](#session-brokering-and-administration) | Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops (“CVAD”, customer managed using LTSR or CR downloadables) on Amazon EC2 |
| [UI services](#ui-user-interface-services) | Citrix StoreFront on Amazon EC2 (customer managed) |
| [Authentication](#authentication) |Citrix StoreFront on EC2 (Citrix ADC/Gateway optional but common) |
| [HDX session proxy](#hdx-session-proxy) | Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on Amazon EC2 (customer managed) |
| VM compute, networking, and storage | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) |
| Active Directory and file systems | Customer managed Windows Server instances on EC2; [AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) and/or [Amazon’s FSx for Windows File Server](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/) (optional) |

In its simplest form, a lift and shift deployment of Citrix
virtualization technology onto AWS resembles a traditional customer
managed deployment on-premises. It leverages a CVAD ‘site’ deployed into
an AWS region and uses basic AWS IaaS services such as EC2 virtual
machines and VPC networking at a minimum. As mentioned above, it
requires the customer to build/configure/maintain all system components,
plus supporting services such as SQL databases. The following diagram
depicts this deployment model:

![Diagram 7: Conceptual Architecture, CVAD: Lift and Shift Deployment Model on AWS](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_007.png)

*Diagram 7: Conceptual Architecture, CVAD: Lift and Shift Deployment Model on AWS.*

It is worth noting that this deployment model also leverages
[AWS Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html)
to provide a highly available design. See
[Availability Zones](#infrastructure-as-code-and-the-aws-object-model) later in
this document for more context.

A lift and shift deployment model is often combined with a hybrid cloud
infrastructure model, leveraging AWS Direct Connect, AWS VPN, Citrix
SD-WAN, or similar networking technology to connect a customer managed
datacenter and resources to AWS. customers can optionally adopt some of
AWS’ more advanced cloud services (to provide a measure of
simplification with the transition), and they may also choose to host
some services (such as SQL databases, Citrix licensing, Citrix
StoreFront, and/or Citrix ADC/Gateway) either on AWS, in a customer
managed datacenter, or both depending upon their existing investments,
use case requirements, etc. A conceptual architecture of this deployment
model (using AWS RDS for SQL Server and/or on-premises SQL server) is
shown below. Note that only one active instance of Citrix Licensing is
needed, but we’ve shown multiple to depict available options:

![Diagram 8: Conceptual Architecture, CVAD: Lift and Shift Deployment Model with Hybrid Cloud infrastructure model and AWS managed cloud services](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_008.png)

#### Lift and Shift - why not

By now you’ve gathered that the Citrix leading practice/recommendation
is to NOT do a full lift and shift. You may be wondering why, and/or
where this is coming from. Referring back to our breakdown of
[Citrix virtualization system components](#citrix-virtualization-system-components), the
[session brokering and administration](#session-brokering-and-administration) subsystem
is the most critical component you’ll want to consider NOT lifting and
shifting. We strongly recommend customers consider using Citrix’s cloud
services for session brokering and administration (i.e. deploy Cloud
Connectors vs. Delivery Controllers + SQL databases + Director servers +
Citrix Licensing servers). Here are some of the primary reasons why we
take this position (and they might sound familiar!):

-  **Simplicity** - While customer managed session brokering services
    provide the ultimate in control and configuration flexibility, it
    comes at the cost of complexity and ongoing maintenance
    requirements. With Citrix Cloud services, simplicity is a
    foundational design tenet. When multiple cloud services are
    leveraged, they come pre-configured to work together, and when
    configuration is necessary, workflows and options are dramatically
    simplified.
-  **Infrastructure and licensing cost savings** - customer managed
    Citrix virtualization services often require additional hardware and
    software to support them, and these have costs associated with them.
    One good example is Microsoft SQL Server: customer managed brokering
    services require databases, and if you’re going to build/manage your
    own, you need to provide them.
-  Speaking of infrastructure cost savings - this brings up a critical
    differentiator between the two session brokering options:
    **Autoscaling**. Citrix’s managed brokering service
    (CVADS) includes the [**autoscale
    feature**](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/autoscale.html),
    which provides built-in VDA capacity and cost management
    functionality. This feature can save customers a substantial amount
    of money on infrastructure when they’re only paying for what they
    use. When running a Citrix virtualization workload on AWS, this
    often means the difference between ponying up for committed use
    discounts and paying for VM usage as you go. The cost savings can be
    dramatic for many use cases, and the Citrix autoscale feature helps
    ensure you’re only consuming what you need.  
    **Important note:** *This feature is only available to Citrix Cloud
    service (i.e. Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service) customers -
    it is not available to customer managed brokering infrastructure
    (i.e. Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops LTSR or CR releases).*
-  **Management savings** - With cloud services, Citrix (and AWS in
    this case) shoulders the responsibility for keeping the services
    highly available, performant, secure, and up to date. You still
    build and manage your VDA’s regardless, but don’t underestimate the
    value of delegating these responsibilities\! Cloud services can go a
    long way towards freeing up IT resources to focus on providing
    unique value to their businesses instead of these critical but
    tedious and often time-consuming tasks.
-  **“Free” upgrades and continuous innovation** - with customer
    managed infrastructure, the onus is on the customer to upgrade and
    patch the components in their care. With cloud services, most of
    those work efforts go away. The service providers (Citrix and AWS in
    this case) tend to be constantly innovating, and they bring these
    innovations to the customers who consume the services, often without
    requiring any work on behalf of the customer.
-  **Access to additional features, functionality, and services -**
    modern service delivery platforms (such as Citrix Cloud and Amazon
    EC2) give technology providers a powerful, cost effective way to
    bring new features, capabilities, and services to market that
    wouldn’t otherwise be possible. Vendors such as Citrix are
    committed to meeting the customer wherever they’re at in their
    digital transformation journey, but sometimes the only way to cost
    effectively deliver new capabilities is to deliver them as a cloud
    service.

#### Lift and Shift - additional resources

Prior to the creation and availability of Citrix Cloud services,
customers were already successfully deploying Citrix virtualization
technologies on AWS. In those days Citrix called the Virtual Apps and
Desktops products XenApp and XenDesktop, and extensive work went into
creating and publishing reference architectures and deployment guides
for this deployment scenario. A good portion of the detail in these
aging resources still apply to deployments who must go down this road
today.

For customers who MUST go down this route, the following published
resources will provide you with useful background detail you can use to
help you be successful. We recommend reviewing these materials before
you continue on with this document, as we’ll be highlighting important
design decisions that have changed since these works were completed:

## Design Decisions

This section will explore key design decisions to consider as you’re
architecting your Citrix virtualization system on AWS. We’ll walk down
through each layer of the Citrix Architectural Design Framework,
exploring key areas for you to consider.

### About the Citrix Architectural Design Framework

Citrix’s Virtual Apps and Desktops solution (the product family name
collectively referring to Citrix’s virtualization technologies) enables
organizations to create, control and manage virtual machines, deliver
applications and desktops, and implement granular security policies. The
Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops solution provides a unified framework
for developing a complete digital workspace offering. This offering
enables Citrix users to access applications and desktops independent of
their device’s operating system and interface.

The Citrix architectural design framework is based on a unified and
standardized layer model. It provides a consistent and easily accessible
framework for understanding the technical architecture for most of the
common Virtual Apps and Desktops deployment scenarios. These layers are
depicted in the conceptual diagram below:

[Diagram 9: Conceptual Architecture, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_009.png)

*Diagram 9: Conceptual Architecture, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service.*

-  ***User Layer*** - This layer defines user groups and locations of
    the Citrix environment.
-  ***Access layer*** - This layer defines how users access the
    resources.
-  ***Control layer*** - This layer defines the components that control
    the Citrix solution.
-  ***Resource layer*** - This layer defines provisioning of Citrix
    workloads and how resources are assigned to the given users.
-  ***Platform layer*** - This layer defines the physical elements
    where the hypervisor components and cloud service provider framework
    run to host the Citrix workloads.
-  ***Operations Layer*** - This layer defines the tools that support
    the delivery of the core solutions.

### User Layer Considerations

In the Citrix Architectural Design Framework, the User layer describes
the user groups, their locations, specific requirements, and more. The
user layer appropriately sets the overall direction for each user
group’s environment. This layer incorporates the assessment criteria
for business priorities and user group requirements in order to define
effective strategies for endpoints and Citrix Workspace App. These
design decisions affect the flexibility and functionality for each user
group.

When designing and deploying a Citrix virtualization system on any
platform, the decisions and strategies adopted after careful assessment
set the foundation for many other decisions that customers will need to
make as they work their way down through the other layers in the Citrix
Architectural Design Framework. As such, this is a very important layer
to understand thoroughly and get right\!

Fortunately, these considerations are already well documented, and don’t
differ substantially between systems deployed on AWS and any other
hardware/cloud platform. For a thorough primer on the design
considerations for this layer, see [Citrix VDI Handbook and Best Practices for XenApp and XenDesktop 7.15 LTSR](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/downloads/handbook-715-ltsr.pdf)
document, and the [Design methodology user layer](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/citrix-vdi-best-practices/design/design-userlayer1.html)
page in particular, for details.

### Access Layer Considerations

In the Citrix Architectural Design Framework, the Access layer defines
how users access AWS resources. The design of your access layer is
critical to the functionality delivered by any Citrix virtualization
system. It controls how users authenticate to the system. It also
controls how users view and launch virtualized applications and
desktops, plus what type of applications and content are available to
them. Additionally, the Access layer controls how and when sessions are
securely proxied or directly connected.

In the context of the [Citrix virtualization
system components](#citrix-virtualization-system-components) we
defined earlier, the access layer contains the following components and
choices:

| [Citrix virtualization system component](#citrix-virtualization-system-components) | Provided by: |
|---|---|
| [UI services](#ui-user-interface-services) | Citrix Workspace (provided by Citrix Cloud) **OR** Citrix StoreFront on Amazon EC2 (customer managed) |
| [Authentication](#authentication) | Citrix Workspace Service (Citrix ADC/Gateway optional) **OR** Citrix StoreFront on EC2 (Citrix ADC/Gateway optional but common) |
| [HDX session proxy](#hdx-session-proxy) | Citrix Gateway Service (provided by Citrix Cloud) **OR** Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on Amazon EC2 (customer managed) |

The table below contains critical decision points when determining which
access layer component to deploy, but the choice is certainly not
binary\! Citrix offers a wide variety of access methods that can be
customized to suit your needs.

#### UI Service and Authentication Considerations

Consider the following when choosing how you want to provide UI services
for your Citrix virtualization system on AWS:

| Attribute / Capability | [Customer Managed](#customer-managed) (installed from downloaded binaries) | [Cloud Service](#cloud-services) (delivered via Citrix Cloud) |
|---|---|---|
| Ability to present and launch virtualized apps and desktops from multiple “Citrix Farms”. | **YES** - Both legacy environments (XenApp/XenDesktop 6.5/7.x, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops CR/LTSR) and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service. | **YES** - Both legacy environments (XenApp/XenDesktop 6.5/7.x, Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops CR/LTSR) and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service. See [this article](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/workspaces/add-on-premises-site.html) for more details. |
| Ability to create multiple ‘Stores’ with different settings for different use cases, including authentication requirements. | **YES** - StoreFront can be configured with multiple different Stores, and when combined with Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX, can apply sophisticated rules to direct certain devices and/or user groups to different stores. For more information, see [How SmartAccess Works for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-gateway/13/integrate-web-interface-apps/ng-smartaccess-wrapper-con/ng-smartaccess-how-it-works-con.html). One common scenario requiring two StoreFront Stores would be when users require published applications from inside a published desktop. Another common scenario would be a requirement of having an internal only Store (no Citrix Gateway access) for a specific use case and another Store configured for both internal and remote access. See [Configure and manage stores](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/storefront/current-release/configure-manage-stores.html) for more information. | **NO** - the Workspace Service is essentially a single store, on a single URL. All users leverage the same store and Workspace settings. Authentication requirements are setup once, and apply to all users of the Workspace tenant. |
| Ability to enumerate, launch, and SSO into SaaS and web apps using the Citrix Access Control service, taking advantage of web-filtering and enhanced security control policies, plus advanced, ML enhanced analytics. | **YES** - leverage the [Access Control Sync for StoreFront](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/advanced-concepts/access-control-saas-web-apps.html) utility. Requires an appropriate subscription to Citrix Cloud. | **YES** - With the Citrix Gateway Service, it is as simple as ‘turning on’ the integration in the Citrix Cloud Console. SaaS apps are defined simply from a web based wizard, and admins can leverage a substantial list of pre-defined apps as a starting point. |
| Ability to access/index/search Citrix Files (formerly ShareFile) content through the Citrix Workspace app and/or web browsers (HTML). | **NO** - StoreFront does not have the ability to integrate file-based content into either Workspace App or StoreFront HTML UI’s. | **YES** - Enabled by default depending upon the subscription to Citrix Cloud. Brings users’ file-based content from a variety of sources (including on-premises file shares) into the Workspace UI, both HTML and Workspace App. |
| Ability to present and launch connections to physical desktops using the [Citrix Remote PC](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/install-configure/remote-pc-access.html) feature. | **YES** - Regardless of whether brokering is handled by CVAD or CVADS. | **YES** - Regardless of whether brokering is handled by CVAD or CVADS. |
| Ability to guide users’ work and automate repetitive tasks by leveraging microapps integrated with a broad variety of different SaaS and/or custom applications. | **NO** - The microapps feature is not currently available with Citrix StoreFront. | **YES** - Presents users with a ‘feed’ in the Workspace UI that intelligently surfaces notifications, tasks, and workflows defined by in-box and custom microapps and the low code Microapp builder console. See [Workspace Intelligence Features - Microapps](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/learn/tech-briefs/workspace-microapps.html) and [Microapps](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-microapps) on Citrix Docs for more information. |
| For multi-site and DR use cases, ability to granularly control session launch behavior using Zone Preference and Failover. | **YES** - Using Citrix Zones for deployments across multiple AWS Regions and Availability Zones is a great way to expand east-west and limit the affected user base in the case of an outage, and allows for Region preference and failover to the Primary Zone seamlessly. See [CVAD Zones documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/manage-deployment/zones.html). | **Partial** - Workspace service doesn’t include the fully featured zone preference and failover functionality, but a similar effect can be implemented using home zones for users and/or apps. See [CVADS Zones documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/zones.html) for details. |
| Ability to broker new and existing connections when a connection between a resource location/zone and Citrix Cloud fails, or when the databases underneath Citrix Delivery Controllers are unavailable. | **YES** - Leverages the Local Host Cache feature on both Cloud Connectors and Delivery Controllers to provide resiliency for these two potential failure scenarios. **For environments with extensive resiliency requirements, Citrix recommends deploying StoreFront with Local Host Cache.** For more information see [Local Host Cache (CVAD)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/manage-deployment/local-host-cache.html). | **YES** - Cloud Connectors leverage the Local Host Cache feature to broker resource connections in the event of Citrix Cloud communication failure. This requires passive StoreFront servers accessible by your resource locations to handle failover scenarios. For more information see [Local Host Cache (CVADS)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/local-host-cache.html). |
| Ability to configure and utilize a customized ‘vanity URL’ for end-user consumption. | **YES** - Customer has full control of the URL’s and certificates used and presented to users. Does require SSL certificate(s), DNS alias creation/management, and Citrix ADC/Gateway instances for ingress over public networks. | **Partial** - All Workspaces are delivered from the cloud.com domain, though customers can [configure their own customized prefix](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/workspace-configuration.html) (i.e. customerXYZ.cloud.com). |
| Ability to intelligently route on-network users directly to VDA’s and off-network users through Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX or Citrix Gateway Service. | **YES** - StoreFront uses administrator defined ‘Beacons’, which the Citrix Workspace App uses to determine if a user is on or off-network. | **Coming Soon** - This feature is expected to be available on Citrix Workspace with the release of the Network Location Service once it is generally available. For more information, see [Network Location Service tech preview](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/workspace-network-location.html). |
| Ability to leverage Citrix Gateway Service for simple, pre-configured HDX session proxy services. | **NO** - If off-network access to Citrix virtualized apps is a requirement (and it is in 99% of deployments), StoreFront requires the use of customer managed Citrix ADC/Gateway for HDX session proxy functionality. | **YES** - This feature is provisioned and enabled by default for all new Citrix Workspace tenants. |
| Includes built-in multi-factor authentication via Active Directory and TOTP. | **YES** - Citrix ADC includes built-in TOTP functionality for use with third-party authenticators, and also supports third-party apps/devices/services. | **YES** - Citrix Workspace includes this feature, including self-service OTP device recovery and automatic push notifications to end users. Supports both Citrix and third-party authenticator apps. |
| SSO capabilities (Virtualized, SaaS and Web apps) | **Partial** - SSO to virtualized apps out of the box. Requires [Access Control Sync for StoreFront](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/advanced-concepts/access-control-saas-web-apps.html) utility for SaaS and Web apps. | **YES** - SSO to virtualized, SaaS and web apps natively available with Citrix Workspace. Gateway Service and Access control include Web Filtering and Policy Controls. |
| Ability to choose from a number of pre-defined authentication methods and have the chosen method apply to all users on the system. | **YES**  - with additional options and flexibility. Citrix StoreFront allows you to create multiple Stores, and authentication methods are configured on a per store basis. One or more options can be configured per store, and admins can select from Active Directory username/password, SAML authentication, domain pass-through, Smart Card, HTTP Basic, and Pass-through from Citrix Gateway options. Self service password reset can also be enabled. See [Configure the authentication service](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/storefront/current-release/configure-authentication-and-delegation/configure-authentication-service.html) for more information. When Citrix ADC/Gateway (customer managed) is deployed and used with StoreFront, a broad variety of authentication options can be configured, along with additional logic to direct users to a specific Store as needed to support almost any use case.  Citrix StoreFront and Citrix ADC/Gateway are recommended where complex integrations and different authentication methods are required for different use cases. | **YES** - Currently, Active Directory, Azure AD, Active Directory + TOTP Token, Azure AD, and Citrix Gateway are currently supported options. Okta and Google Cloud ID options are in tech preview or coming soon. See [Secure workspaces](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace/secure.html) for more information. With the exception of Citrix Gateway, your authentication choice applies to all users and all services provided through the Citrix Workspace tenant/URL. With the Citrix Gateway option, customers can support a broad variety of authentication options (RADIUS MFA, smart card, federation, conditional access policies, etc.) and flexibly apply them to different groups of users and use cases. For more information, see [Connect an on-premises Citrix Gateway as an identity provider to Citrix Cloud](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud-management/identity-access-management/connect-ad-gateway.html). |
| Ability to SSO to sessions on VDA’s when launching virtualized Windows apps/desktops using federated identity providers | **YES** - Citrix [Federated Authentication Service](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/federated-authentication-service.html) (FAS) enables SSO to VDA’s when using a federated identity provider such as SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language). | **Coming Soon** - By using Citrix [Federated Authentication Service](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/federated-authentication-service.html) (FAS) with Citrix Workspace. This feature is in tech preview as of this writing. See [Enable SSO for Workspaces with Citrix FAS](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-workspace/workspace-federated-authentication.html) for more information. |

#### HDX Session Proxy Considerations

Consider the following when choosing how you want to provide HDX session
proxy functionality for your Citrix virtualization system on AWS:

| Attribute / Capability | [Customer Managed](#customer-managed) (Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on AWS) | [Cloud Service](#cloud-services) ([Citrix Gateway Service](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-gateway-service.html) provided by Citrix Cloud) |
|---|---|---|

#### Summary, Recommendations, and Leading Practices

Now that we’ve reviewed some of the attributes/features/capabilities
that help drive your customer managed vs. cloud service decisions for
the Access Layer subsystems, let’s examine the top level decisions in
the context of the [deployment models](#common-deployment-models-for-citrix-virtualization-on-aws)
we defined earlier.

##### Access Layer: Greenfield/Cloud Only Deployment

Since the greenfield or cloud only deployment model leverage cloud
services across the board, the AWS specific implications on the design
of your Citrix virtualization system are simple: there aren’t any\!
There’s no need to build or configure anything on AWS since everything
required for both UI and HDX proxy services are provided for you,
configured and ready to go ‘out of the box’.

The Access Layer of a Citrix deployment is a key requirement for
delivering virtual apps and desktops to users. If an access point is
unreachable or fails, users cannot access their resources. Network
design and implementation can be complicated, but with Citrix Gateway
Service and Citrix Workspace, redundancy, failover, maintenance, and
global presence are all part of the package - with no networking
knowledge required\! Leveraging Citrix Gateway Service and Citrix
Workspace can reduce your infrastructure footprint substantially. By
moving the access layer to a cloud services model, users can securely
access network resources from anywhere in the world. This approach
requires the least deployment and maintenance efforts, so it is a great
option if you want to get up-and-running quickly, have a limited IT
staff, or if infrastructure is not your focus. With everything
pre-configured, this deployment model is the least customizable, but for
deploying a simple, secure, fully functional, globally accessible
system, using Citrix Workspace and Gateway Service for your access layer
is the way to go.

##### Access Layer: Hybrid Deployment

With the hybrid deployment model, you’re going to be building/managing
some of the Citrix virtualization system components, otherwise it is a
greenfield or cloud only deployment by definition\! With the hybrid
model, you’re possibly deploying Citrix ADC/Gateway VPXs on AWS or even
on-premises, and depending upon your requirements, you might also be
deploying Citrix StoreFront on AWS or on-premises. Customers who have
made significant investments in their on-premises Gateway and identity
solutions can benefit from the ability to leverage
[Citrix Gateway as the Identity provider for Workspace](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/aaa-tm/use-citrix-gateway-as-idp-for-citrix-cloud.html).

This deployment model is common for security-focused deployments,
deployments with current on-prem hardware infrastructure (ADC and/or
StoreFront), and for DR/failover sites for existing customer managed
datacenters. One of the key considerations for this model is keeping
your users, resources, and access points as close together as possible.
Choose AWS regions near the on-prem resource locations in which to
deploy your Access Layer. Where possible, keep your ADCs and StoreFront
servers as close as possible to each other. This is where things can get
tricky\! Consider the [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops launch sequence](https://www.basvankaam.com/2016/12/19/demystifying-the-citrix-xenapp-logon-enumeration-and-launch-steps-new-details-included/)
when designing your hybrid deployment, noting especially that all
traffic is routed through the Citrix ADC.

With Citrix ADC/Gateway and StoreFront as EC2-based instances in AWS,
there is also much more potential for customization. In addition to the
multiple StoreFront stores, multi-factor authentication, and a variety
of industry-leading ADC features, hybrid deployments can also leverage
native AWS services such as the Relational Database Service (RDS) and
AWS Directory Services. Hybrid deployments lend well to a more gradual
cloud transition and leave room for adjustments to the architecture
along the way, as opposed to lift and shift methods.

The hybrid approach does require a higher level of expertise and
increased lead time to deploy than the greenfield/cloud only model, but
can serve as a solid transition state between a traditional customer
managed/on-prem deployment and cloud only state.

##### Access Layer: Lift and Shift Deployment

With the legacy lift and shift deployment model, you’re deploying both
Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX’s and Citrix StoreFront on AWS, or potentially
leveraging existing on-premises deployments of these technologies for
the same purpose. This type of deployment tends to have the least lead
time for customers with existing on-prem Citrix virtualization
environments, and is also the easiest transition from an Operations and
Maintenance perspective. Staff with experience managing an on-prem
environment will have a shorter ramp-up time with the lift and shift
deployment model, as the Citrix infrastructure remains largely
unchanged. For the access layer specifically, this method is very
straightforward and allows for many customizations. The lift and shift
is a great first step for existing deployments going into the cloud or
for new or air-gapped AWS regions, but may be a hindrance to adopting a
cloud-forward architecture in the future.

### Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on AWS

Deploying the Citrix ADC/Gateway on AWS is different than deploying it
on premises, though in the end you’re managing them yourself.
Fortunately deploying Citrix ADC/Gateway on AWS is thoroughly
documented, so we recommend reviewing the following resources before you
solidify your design and begin implementation:

-  [Citrix ADC VPX on AWS in Citrix Docs](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-aws.html): Provides a comprehensive overview of Citrix ADC on AWS, including supported VPX models, AWS regions, EC2 instance types, and additional resource references.
-  [Citrix ADC and Amazon Web Services Validated Reference Design](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/advanced-concepts/design-guides/netscaler-and-amazon-aws.html) in Citrix Docs/Advanced Concepts - includes additional details and deployment guidance.
-  [Citrix ADC for Web Applications Quick Start Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-adc-vpx/) template: functional and relevant for Citrix Gateway deployments with CVAD/CVADS also, though Citrix and AWS are working on an additional Quick Start for this specific use case.
-  [Read.me](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-adc-aws-cloudformation/blob/master/templates/README.md) from Citrix ADC on AWS QuickStart Cloud Formation template - an excellent reference for available Citrix Networking products on AWS Marketplace, and also provides AMI ID’s for all available regions/instance types/firmware models.

While there are potential variants for a Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX
architecture on AWS, the following diagram (from the
[Citrix ADC for Web Applications Quick Start Deployment Guide](https://aws-quickstart.s3.amazonaws.com/quickstart-citrix-adc-vpx/doc/citrix-adc-vpx-for-web-applications-on-the-aws-cloud.pdf))
depicts a multi-AZ Citrix HA pair deployment as deployed by the Quick
Start template (with default subnets/CIDR blocks):

![Diagram 10: Conceptual Architecture, Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on AWS with HA across Availability Zones](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_010.png)

*Diagram 10: Conceptual Architecture, Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX on AWS with HA across Availability Zones.*

As discussed in [Citrix ADC VPX on AWS](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-aws.html)
on Citrix Docs, there are two primary deployment options available. They
are:

-  [Standalone](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-aws/launch-vpx-for-aws-ami.html)

    -  Individual instances of Citrix ADC/Gateway can be deployed and
    managed as separate entities. This is commonly used for smaller
    scale or POC deployments where high availability is not a
    requirement.

-  [High Availability](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-aws/how-aws-ha-works.html)

    -  This is the most commonly deployed model for production
    environments: pairs of Citrix ADC/Gateway VPX instances can be
    deployed leveraging native Citrix HA mode on AWS. With older
    firmware versions, the pair is deployed in the same AWS Availability
    Zone. [Starting with Citrix ADC 12.1](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/advanced-concepts/design-guides/netscaler-and-amazon-aws.html)
    firmware, highly available pairs of VPX appliances can be deployed
    across Availability Zones (AZ). [How high availability on AWS works](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/deploying-vpx/deploy-aws/how-aws-ha-works.html)
    explains the difference between deploying a pair of ADCs within the
    same AZ and across AZs. We’ll dig into this option more deeply later
    in this section.

While Citrix ADC VPX generally supports single, dual, or multiple NIC
deployment types, Citrix recommends using at least three subnets for
each ADC when deployed on AWS, with a network interface in each subnet
for optimum throughput and data separation. When deployed to support
Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, the NSIP is typically attached to the
“Private Citrix Infrastructure Subnet”, the SNIP is attached to the
“Private Citrix VDA Subnet”, and the Citrix Gateway VIP to the “Public
Subnet”. The following simplified conceptual diagram depicts this
configuration. Note that it shows a single VPX instance in a single AZ -
this design pattern would be duplicated (likely in a second AZ) for a
High Availability configuration:

![Diagram 11: Citrix ADC VPX instance interface mapping for CVAD/CVADS deployments](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_011.png)

*Diagram 11: Citrix ADC VPX instance interface mapping for CVAD/CVADS deployments.*

#### ADC High Availability across Availability Zones

As mentioned earlier, this is the most common deployment model for
Citrix virtualization systems. This model leverages a pair of Citrix ADC
VPXs deployed across Availability Zones by either leveraging Citrix
ADC’s native HA (active/passive) feature or a combination of Citrix
ADC’s native Global Service Load Balancing (GSLB) and IPSet features.
The latter option (which became feasible in early 2020) allows for an
active/active configuration across AZ’s, and functions by allowing the
ADC to act as an authoritative DNS source. This new option/architecture
is expected to be popular for public cloud deployments, so we’ll focus
on that here.

The Domain Based Services for cloud load balancers allow for
auto-discovery of dynamic cloud services. By deploying Citrix ADCs
across multiple AZs in an active-active configuration, you can leverage
cloud resources in different AZs to optimize High Availability/Disaster
Recovery. Each AZ can contain cloud resources in the familiar
[Pod Infrastructure](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/09/11/better-than-ever-xenappxendesktop-site-design-v2017/),
to allow for easily managed updates, patching, and scalability for
expansion. For detailed information about setting up GSLB between AWS
AZs, see [Citrix Documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/advanced-concepts/design-guides/netscaler-and-amazon-aws.html).

![Diagram 12: Traffic flow before and after HA failover in multi-AZ HA deployment](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_012.png)

*Diagram 12: Traffic flow before and after HA failover in multi-AZ HA deployment.*

In the above diagram, we can see that each ADC has a different Gateway
virtual IP (VIP). This is characteristic of an
[Independent Network Configuration (INC)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-gateway/13/high-availability/ng-ha-routed-networks-con.html).
When VPXs in an HA pair reside in different Availability Zones, the
secondary ADC must have an INC, as they cannot share mapped IP
addresses, virtual LANs, or network routes. The NSIP will be different
for each ADC in this configuration, while SNIPs and Load Balancing VIPs
will utilize a special [Citrix ADC feature called IPset](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/13/load-balancing/load-balancing-customizing/multi-ip-virtual-servers.html),
or Multi-IP virtual servers, which can be used for clients in different
subnets to connect to the same set of servers. With IPset, you can
associate a private IP to each of the primary and secondary instances. A
public IP can then be mapped to the primary ADC in the pair. In the case
of failover, the public IP mapping will change dynamically to the new
primary. For GSLB deployments in AWS, the service IP can be part of the
IPset for both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic\!

For more information on adding a remote node to an ADC to create an
INC-based HA pair, see [Citrix docs](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-gateway/13/high-availability/ng-ha-routed-networks-con/ng-ha-add-remote-node-tsk.html)
and watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhBxA_5Y2Cc&feature=youtu.be)
from the Citrix YouTube channel.

### Citrix StoreFront on AWS

Deploying Citrix StoreFront on AWS is not much different than deploying
it on premises, and in the end, you’re also managing all the components
of StoreFront yourself too. See [Plan your StoreFront deployment](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/storefront/current-release/plan.html)
for general considerations which apply to all deployments including
StoreFront on AWS. The main difference is that you typically deploy
multiple StoreFront instances in a StoreFront server group across
multiple AWS availability zones. It is important to note that the
features enabled with this design are **dependent upon latency between
AZ’s**. Per [Plan your StoreFront Deployment/Scalability](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/storefront/current-release/plan.html#scalability),
StoreFront server group deployments are only supported where links
between servers in a server group have latency of less than 40ms (with
subscriptions disabled) or less than 3ms (with subscriptions enabled).
Make sure you measure latencies between instances in all AZ’s you plan
to host StoreFront and enable/disable subscriptions accordingly.

We already called this out in the [UI Service and Authentication Considerations](#ui-service-and-authentication-considerations)
table earlier in this document, but it is worth calling out again: **For
Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service environments with extensive
resiliency requirements, Citrix strongly recommends a StoreFront
implementation to fully benefit from the Local Host Cache feature**
(available in both CVAD and CVADS session brokering infrastructure
types). For CVAD, this provides resiliency in case of a database outage.
For CVADS, this architecture provides resiliency in case Cloud
Connectors cannot reach Citrix Cloud. In either case, disconnected users
will still be able to connect to new and existing sessions during an
outage scenario. For more details, limitations, and implications of
Local Host cache activation, see [Local Host Cache (CVADS)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/local-host-cache.html)
and [Local Host Cache (CVAD)](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/manage-deployment/local-host-cache.html).

While we’re on the topic of resilience, Citrix also recommends that your
StoreFront implementation span multiple AZs (if the AWS region includes
multiple AZ’s), but remember to take the ADC design into account\!
Citrix ADC is often used in front of StoreFront instances to provide
load balancing and additional service resiliency.

By utilizing [Citrix Zones](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/manage-deployment/zones.html),
StoreFront redundancy can be built in by spreading satellite zones
across two or more AZs in a VPC with a single site. Using Zones is a
great way to have resources as close to the users as possible and highly
available. Satellite Zones contain StoreFront servers, Delivery
Controllers, and app/desktop resources, leaving the Primary Zone with
the full infrastructure setup, including the license server and SQL.
This allows for scalability of StoreFront web UI and Zone
creation/destruction can be orchestrated. Keeping the Zones smaller will
allow for optimal east-west scalability and reduce the impact in the
case of an outage.

StoreFront on AWS is fully customizable, including Featured App Groups,
splash page, coloring and logo, and apps and desktops can be arranged in
the best way for your specific needs. StoreFront on AWS also requires
knowledgeable administration and engineering to be kept up, but can
provide a powerful web UI, especially when integrated with the Citrix
ADC\!

## Resource Layer Considerations

The Resource Layer design focuses on personalization, applications, and
image design. The Resource Layer is where users will interact with
desktops and applications. When deploying a Citrix virtualization system
on AWS, the key things to keep in mind (aside from all the ‘normal’
stuff we won’t cover here) are:

-  **CIFS storage and data replication** - Regardless of the tooling
    you use for managing user personalization settings (i.e. the users’
    Windows profile and redirected folders) you’ve got to have Windows
    file shares to store them on. If you’ve got VDAs in multiple regions
    (and users can access apps/desktops in more than one) then you’ve
    also got to deal with data replication. Many applications also
    leverage Windows file shares, so CIFS storage and data replication
    are important for these too.
-  **Image design** - Citrix App Layering and Citrix Provisioning
    Services (PVS) do not currently support Amazon EC2 - customers
    hosting a resource location in AWS leverage Machine Creation
    Services for VDA fleet creation, management, and updating.

### CIFS Storage and Data Replication

Most Citrix virtualization systems on AWS will require at least basic
access to a Windows compatible file share in order to persist user
settings, user data, and/or application data. When these shares are not
available, the user experience and/or application functionality will
suffer, so it is important to ensure that whatever solution you choose
to provide Windows compatible file shares is highly available and data
is regularly backed up.

For multi-site deployments, reliable and performant data replication may
also be necessary to meet availability, RPO, and RTO needs. This will be
especially true for environments where users may connect to
desktops/apps in 2 or more regions, and application data/user settings
must be available in the region where the apps/desktops run. Below are
some solutions to consider for providing CIFS storage and data
replication services on AWS.

While non-Windows solutions for providing Windows file shares exist,
most of these solutions cannot deliver the indexing capabilities
required for search functionality inside of a Windows desktop or
applications such as Microsoft Outlook running on Windows. As such, most
customers turn to Windows-based file server solutions, at least for
storing user profiles and persistent application data. Fortunately, both
customer managed and cloud service options are available for use when
Citrix virtualization systems are run on AWS.

#### Customer Managed: Windows File Servers on Amazon EC2

The first solution many customers consider for providing Windows
compatible file services on AWS is building their own Windows file
servers on EC2 to serve each resource location on AWS. Since Windows
file servers are needed by a broad variety of different types of
applications and workloads, many IT shops may gravitate towards building
and managing their own since this is something they know how to do. At
the most basic level, the customer spins up one or more Windows EC2
instances, attach additional Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume,
join the instance’s to their Active Directory, and get busy configuring
and setting up Windows File Services.

This option, as you might imagine, provides customers with the most
control and flexibility. While this is very appealing to certain types
of customers and certain verticals, it also comes at a cost: the
responsibility to size, scale, build, manage, patch, secure, and
maintain everything from the Windows OS up. Customers electing to go
this route should also ensure these file servers are highly available.
This is often accomplished using file servers in multiple Availability
Zones, and leveraging Windows DFS-N/DFS-R, though it’s easy to end up in
an unsupported configuration (per Microsoft) if you’re not careful.

***Note:** Customers considering this option should review
[Microsoft’s support statement](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2533009/information-about-microsoft-support-policy-for-a-dfs-r-and-dfs-n-deplo)
regarding using DFS-R and DFS-N for roaming profile shares and folder
redirection shares.*

One additional point to consider since the Citrix virtualization system
will be running on AWS: a new deployment or migration event may provide
an excellent opportunity to evaluate using a cloud service for Windows
file services instead of building your own. Fortunately, Amazon has some
cloud service options worth considering. We’ll touch on some of these
now.

#### Cloud Service: Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

[Amazon’s FSx for Windows File Server](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/) is a cloud service
which customers can consume on AWS. FSx for Windows File Server provides
a fully managed, native Windows file system, and SSD-based storage with
consistent sub-millisecond performance. Since FSx is built on Windows
Server, it delivers a fully native, Windows compatible file system that
provides storage and protection for Citrix virtualization systems on
AWS. FSx for Windows File Server is also Citrix Ready Verified, meaning
this AWS supported solution has been validated by Citrix to be
compatible with Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops. While it is not
officially supported by Citrix, the service IS fundamentally native
Microsoft Windows file server - it is just managed by AWS instead of the
customer. For more information, see [Amazon FSX for Windows File Server on Citrix Ready](https://citrixready.citrix.com/amazon-com/amazon-fsx-for-windows-file-server.html).

For IT teams, this is an excellent option that removes many of the more
mundane or low-value tasks around deploying and managing storage. Most
importantly, using FSx offloads security, data protection/backup,
compliance, software updating/patching tasks, and the monitoring of
storage infrastructure to make sure it meets required service levels. IT
teams can treat the entire FSx file service as a single operational
platform instead of managing a Windows operating system file server,
storage, networking, etc. Additionally, FSx supports all the common
management tools it already uses, such as Active Directory (AD)
integration, Windows DFS Namespaces, DFS Replication, and others.

Each FSx managed file system you create essentially becomes a highly
available and durable file server in a specific Availability Zone. For
servicing a Citrix virtualization system, customers should ensure these
“file systems” are highly available. This can be accomplished by
provisioning FSx managed file systems in multiple availability zones,
and leveraging Windows DFS-N/DFS-R to create highly available Windows
file shares, though it’s easy to end up in an unsupported configuration
(per Microsoft) if you’re not careful.

***Note:** Since FSx is a Windows file server, customers considering
this option should review [Microsoft’s support statement](https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2533009/information-about-microsoft-support-policy-for-a-dfs-r-and-dfs-n-deplo)
regarding using DFS-R and DFS-N for roaming profile shares and folder
redirection shares.*

#### Additional Cloud Service Options

Besides Amazon’s first party managed Windows file service, AWS supports
many more expansive and feature rich options, some of which integrate
with traditional on-premises storage technologies. While these other
options are outside the scope of this document, there are many options
to choose from. A good place to start exploring options is on the
[AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/). These types of
solutions can be especially relevant for more complex, multi-region use
cases where reliable and resilient data replication is needed.

#### CIFS Storage and Data Replication: Summary and Conclusions

Customers can manage their own highly available DFS file share, benefit
from this as an AWS service (FSx) to save on management effort, or use
third party storage appliance solutions to extend on an on premises
environment. Citrix recommends that customers analyze the pros and cons
of each to determine a solution that is right for them.

### Image Design and Management

In a Citrix virtualization system on AWS, applications and desktops are
delivered via EC2 instances called “VDA’s” (named after Citrix’s Virtual
Delivery Agent software, which is installed into Windows or Linux
instances containing the applications being delivered by the Citrix
virtualization system). A group of identical VDA’s are provisioned and
maintained in “Machine Catalogs”, a management construct defined and
maintained through the session brokering and management subsystem (both
CVADS and CVAD). The creation, sizing, and management of these instances
is key, as many systems have large numbers of VDAs and the software
stack in a VDA changes frequently as hotfixes, service packs, and
software updates are applied. We’ll discuss some of the higher-level
considerations in this section.

#### Provisioning and VDA Image Management

On AWS EC2, Citrix virtualization systems leverage Citrix’s Machine
Creation Services (MCS) provisioning technology for VDA deployment and
image management. MCS utilizes an IAM service account on EC2 to
orchestrate the mastering process (turning a snapshot of a template VM’s
system disk into a generalized AMI), the cloning process (creating and
managing a fleet of VDA instances based upon the AMI created from the
snapshot of the template VM), autoscaling Delivery Groups, updating
deployed images, and more. We’ll discuss MCS on AWS in much more detail
in the [Control Layer Considerations](#operations-layer-considerations) sections of
this document.

**Note:** customers already using MCS for their on premises
environments may notice some differences between options available to
them when provisioning machines in AWS. MCS managed VDA instances on EC2
will have two disks attached: the system disk (a read/write copy of the
template image AMI created during the mastering process) and a 1GB
personality disk. Depending on the machine catalog type and hosting
connection options configured, the system disk (and sometimes the VM
instance) will be deleted at shutdown and recreated at ‘power on’ (for
pooled or shared catalogs) or they will be retained (for persistent
catalog types). See [CTX234562](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX234562)
for more information.

#### Delivery and Persistence Models

Choosing the right delivery model(s) is critical and has broad
implications beyond just cost. Citrix virtualization technology supports
three main delivery models, which can be mixed and matched and used in
combination to support a broad variety of use cases. The three delivery
models are:

-  **Hosted shared:** The hosted shared model most commonly utilizes a
Windows Server OS with the RDSH role installed, though Linux instances
can provide the same functionality for compatible apps. With this model,
a single VDA instance can support multiple simultaneous users, each
running either a full desktop or connecting to one or more published
applications. When using Windows Server OS/RDSH with the Desktop
Experience and related components installed, desktops and apps look and
feel like they’re running on a Windows desktop OS. Since every user on a
given instance shares the same OS instance, administrators typically
pre-install and configure the mix of applications on hosted shared
instances, and users do not have local administrator rights to the OS.
Hosted shared instances can also run on shared infrastructure, and can
be consumed using both on-demand and reserved instance pricing models.
Administrators usually deploy a fleet of instances to support the hosted
shared model, and both customer managed and cloud service types of
Citrix brokering subsystems provide sophisticated load balancing
capabilities to ensure every user experiences adequate performance.
Hosted shared instances can also leverage GPU backed instance types on
AWS to increase performance for graphically intensive workloads that can
benefit from a GPU, though the GPU vendor may require additional
licenses. Both Windows Server OS and RDS CAL licenses can be ‘rented’
under Microsoft’s SPLA licensing model, though customers can avoid these
additional costs by leveraging Linux as the OS. *This model is, hands
down, the most cost effective to run on AWS.*

-  **Server VDI:** The “Server VDI” model also leverages a Windows Server
OS, and with the Desktop Experience and related components installed, it
looks and feels to the user just like a Windows Desktop OS. The RDSH
role is not installed with this model, so one instance supports one user
at a time, and users are sometimes provided with elevated rights to the
Server OS so they can install their own applications. Like hosted shared
instances, server VDI instances can also run on shared infrastructure,
can be consumed using both on-demand and reserved instance pricing
models, can leverage GPU backed instance types, and Microsoft OS and RDS
CALs can be ‘rented’ under Microsoft’s SPLA licensing model. Given the
tools available today, 99+% of Windows applications can be installed and
ran on the Windows Server OS, and though sometimes software vendors
don’t explicitly support their applications on Windows Server, most
Windows apps run just as well as they do on a Windows Desktop OS. It’s
also worth noting that server VDI instances can also leverage GPU backed
instance types on AWS to increase performance for graphically intensive
workloads that can benefit from a GPU, though the GPU vendor may require
additional licenses. *This is the second most cost-effective delivery
model to run on AWS.*

-  **Client VDI:** The client VDI delivery model typically leverages a
Windows desktop OS such as Windows 10 or Windows 7, although a supported
Linux OS version can be used as well. Client VDI is a 1:1 model, meaning
each unique user requires their own OS instance. Customers who are new
to Citrix virtualization technology often come into these types of
projects asking for client VDI, even though more cost-effective models
are available. Their vernacular may also have been influenced by other
virtualization vendors whose technology stacks don’t support hosted
shared or server VDI deployment models. The client VDI model, while
looking ‘simpler’ on the surface, gets much more complicated the deeper
you get into it, though most of the complexity can be avoided by using
Linux as the OS. Most of this complication is driven by Microsoft’s
licensing requirements for the Windows Desktop OS which, unlike Windows
Server, is not available via Microsoft’s SPLA licensing program. As
such, customers need to bring their own licensing for these products.
Additionally - Windows desktop based client VDI instances cannot run on
shared infrastructure. This means that client VDI instances must run in
either AWS dedicated instances or on AWS dedicated hosts. This
substantially increases the cost and complexity of managing the
infrastructure required, reduces flexibility and cost control options,
and gets expensive quickly. As you might expect, client VDI instances
can also leverage GPU backed instance types on AWS to increase
performance for graphically intensive workloads that can benefit from a
GPU, though the GPU vendor may require additional licenses. *Client VDI
is the most expensive delivery model to run on AWS.*

For both VDI models, another important consideration is the persistence
model. VDI instances can be randomly assigned to users with no
persistence (pooled) or users may have assigned machines that persist
and are personalized (dedicated). Pooled instances can be easier to
manage over time since all instances in a given pool are identical.
Citrix’s MCS can update the system disks attached to pooled instances
with a few clicks, and capacity/cost management is more effective since
an idle pool of instances can service a broad number of users. Pooled
instances are a bit less flexible than dedicated since end-user changes
to pooled instances don’t usually persist between reboots, though
technologies such as Citrix App Layering’s User Layer or Personalization
Layer released in CVAD 1912 can be used to minimize the impact on the
user experience. Dedicated instances can also be tougher to manage from
a cost perspective too - since it is often tough to predict when a user
will log on, the user will either have to wait for a few minutes while
their instance is started, or administrators will need to try to keep
them running during time windows where each user is expected to log on.

While we’ve mentioned it above, we’re going to mention it again here for
clarity: various flavors of Linux can be used in a Citrix virtualization
system, as long as the application(s) run on Linux. Citrix’s
virtualization technology supports both hosted shared and VDI delivery
models, persistent and pooled models, and GPU backed instance types. The
user and administrator experiences are very different than with Windows
based instances, but Linux based VDA’s are often much less expensive to
run since they don’t require Microsoft licenses.

Finally, let’s revisit the consideration of GPU acceleration. All three
delivery models (for both Linux and Windows) can leverage NVIDIA
accelerated GPU instances on AWS. G-series instances can be used for
graphics accelerated use cases, but are not yet commercially viable for
general purpose usage. Note that Citrix doesn’t support AWS Elastic GPU
today, but since Elastic GPU only works for OpenGL, its impact on
typical graphics workloads in the enterprise is minimal.

So - which delivery model(s) should you use? It is worth noting that you
can mix and match delivery models in the same system to meet the needs
of different user groups and/or use cases. **The most cost-effective
delivery model from an infrastructure perspective is hosted-shared**.
The combination of server OS with multi-user concurrency is highly
efficient, and the number of users per virtual machine can be sized
accordingly depending on user type (i.e. task worker, knowledge worker,
power user, etc.) to ensure a great experience. For situations where
users and apps require additional capabilities that aren’t satisfied by
hosted-shared, VDI is the way to go. Server VDI should be evaluated
first: it is substantially more cost-effective to run than Windows 10
VDI for Windows workloads, and Server VDI can deliver a desktop that
looks and feels very similar to Windows 10. Additionally, Server VDI
doesn’t have the Microsoft EULA requirement to use dedicated
instances/hosts - Client VDI (i.e., deploying Windows 10 or sometimes
Windows 7) does. For Windows based workloads on AWS, Client VDI should
be considered as a last resort, and deployed only when hosted shared and
Server VDI delivery models are not possible.

In order to help with the decision making process, the following
decision tree compares [Hosted Shared Desktops (Server OS multi-user desktops) to VDI Desktops](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/design-decisions_application-delivery-methods_003.png).
Note that the tree doesn’t explicitly differentiate between client VDI
and server VDI models. When a use case suggests VDI is the appropriate
delivery model for your workload, Server VDI should be strongly
considered wherever possible for running on AWS as it is substantially
more cost effective and easier to manage.

#### AWS Instance Billing Model

Once you’ve decided which delivery model to use (hosted-shared, server
VDI, and/or client VDI), the next step is to plan for an hourly
on-demand billing model or a reserved billing model. Ideally, as many
VDAs as possible should be paid for by the hour with the on-demand
billing model, and leverage the [Citrix Autoscale](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/autoscale.html)
feature to control costs. By leveraging Citrix Autoscale (a feature
exclusive to the CVADS cloud service brokering subsystem) VMs are
powered on as needed with anticipation for peak hours. During off peak
hours, however, VMs will be shut down so its important to consolidate
loads with the hosted-shared model and for all models ensure that users
save their work and ideally logoff gracefully from their sessions.
Reserved instance capacity may be used for infrastructure components
like the Cloud Connectors which remain on 24/7, as well as a
predetermined amount of VDAs that will always remain on (e.g. 10% of
peak). Besides providing significant discount compared to On-Demand
pricing, Reserve Instances also provide a capacity reservation when used
in a specific Availability Zone.

#### VDA Instance Sizing and Cost Management

When running a fleet of VDA’s on AWS, choosing the right instance type
for your different workloads (VDA’s) is a key decision, with substantial
performance, manageability, and cost considerations. Choose too small of
an instance and performance can suffer. Choose too large of an instance,
and you’re paying for resources you’re not using. Choosing the right
instance type ends up being a balancing act, and often requires fine
tuning for each specific workload.

Which AWS EC2 instance type to choose for your VDAs depends heavily upon
the specific workload and delivery type; however, as a general
guideline, “M” series instances are often most suitable for
hosted-shared whereas “T” series instances are suitable for VDI. “M”
series has balanced CPU and RAM designed for the mostly predictable
resource consumption across multiple sessions on a host. “T” series are
“burstable” in nature designed for the mostly unpredictable
characteristics of VDI (e.g. one minute a user is idling and the next
they are running a macro calculation). For additional details on
instance type selection and pricing, please refer to the [Citrix on AWS
cost estimation presentation](/en-us/tech-zone/design/downloads/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_costs.pptx).

For more information regarding instance selection (especially as it
applies to the hosted shared delivery model) see
[Citrix Scalability in a Cloud World – 2018 Edition](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2018/08/16/citrix-scalability-in-a-cloud-world-2018-edition/).
This article, while slightly dated, discusses leading practices
regarding instance selection based on performance, manageability, cost,
reserved vs. on demand pricing models, and LoginVSI scalability testing.
These concepts and considerations are still extremely valid today, even
though instance choices and pricing have likely changed since its
initial publication.

***Note:** Some newer AWS instance types will not show up by default in
the Machine Catalog creation wizard in Studio (either CVAD or CVADS).
The UI is populated with instance types from a static XML file which
resides on Delivery Controllers (CVAD) or Cloud Connectors (CVADS). This
XML can be modified to include newer instance types, but this file is
overwritten with default values during upgrades (both Citrix initiated
Cloud Connector updates or customer-initiated Delivery Controller
upgrades). See [CTX139707](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX139707?_ga=2.25237309.1017824996.1576508025-674023236.1532570336)
for more details on how to update the list of available AWS instance
types.*

To get a better idea of how instances are commonly sized on AWS (or any
other platform) see this [detailed AWS LoginVSI blog](https://www.loginvsi.com/blog-alias/login-vsi/901-citrix-virtual-app-user-density-on-aws).
During this round of testing (a point in time reference) the M5.2Xlarge
instance type (8vCPU, 32GB RAM) turned out to be the winner in terms of
$/user/hour (with an industry standard sample workload). Your numbers -
given your specific workload characteristics and available AWS pricing -
may vary, but the process and tooling can be leveraged to approximate
your monthly IaaS costing more accurately. Regardless of how you
determine the instance types you start with, it is important to monitor
usage over time and adjust as needed to keep the balance between
resource availability, consumption and cost. Customers should consider
leveraging services such as [Citrix Analytics for Performance](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/learn/tech-insights/performance-analytics.html) - the information such services provide can play a key role in keeping performance up and costs down.

#### Application Design

An additional consideration includes application design. As customers
are planning to migrate workloads to a cloud platform such as AWS for
their resource location(s), they need to ensure that app performance is
not impacted. A rule of thumb which has applied for over 20 years is
that the data should reside as near as possible to the workload. This
means more complex applications architectures should respect this rule.
An example of this includes apps with a frontend and backend (database).
In order to avoid adding latency which will impact application
performance, both the frontend and backend should be migrated. An
alternative would be a hybrid approach using a mix of on premises (for
complex apps) and cloud hosted workloads (for simple applications). It
is important to always consult with application vendors for
compatibility. The linked Tech Zone decision matrix compares the
different [Hosted Shared delivery methods](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/design-decisions_application-delivery-methods_004.png),
which include Hosted Shared Applications (single and multi-use) and
Hosted Shared Desktops. The workload segmentation decision making
process this article outlines can be used as a guide for the workload
design process.

One final word on application design, and something existing Citrix
customers who have adopted or are adopting Citrix App Layering
technology *need to know*: **App Layering, in the formal sense, does not
currently support AWS.** The Enterprise Layer Manager appliance does not
currently run on AWS, and does not currently support exporting layered
images into an immediately consumable disk format for use on AWS. It is
technically possible to export a layered image to another format (like
VMDK), then import and convert a layered image into a usable Amazon
Machine Image (AMI), however this process is currently unsupported. If
App Layering support on AWS is critical for your migration or
deployment, please email [aws@citrix.com](mailto:aws@citrix.com)
with information about your project. You’ll be added to the list to be
an early adopter candidate for future releases, and your voice will be
heard. For more information on Citrix App Layering, refer to the
[product documentation](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-app-layering/4.html)
and [App Layering reference architecture](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/tech-zone/design/reference-architectures/app-layering.html).

## Control Layer Considerations

In the Citrix Architectural Design Framework, the Control layer defines
the components that control the Citrix solution. This includes
components like Active Directory (forest/domain, OU, and user group
structure, etc.), Microsoft SQL database usage, Citrix licensing,
session brokering and administration, load management, and VDA
provisioning/image management. As with previous sections of this
document, here we’ll focus on the considerations which are most
important for Citrix virtualization systems on AWS, and provide links to
existing documentation/guidance on others.

One of the most impactful decisions you’ll be making for control layer
components is the session brokering and administration choice. This
decision is critical, with substantial implications on cost, complexity,
availability, and ongoing maintenance efforts. We’ll start by reviewing
the deployment models we introduced earlier in this document, then dig
more deeply into the AWS specific considerations.

### Control Layer: Greenfield/Cloud Only Deployment

The greenfield or cloud only deployment model leverages cloud services
across the board. As you might imagine, this model is the simplest and
most cost effective to build, manage, and maintain over time as many of
the Citrix virtualization system components are provided and/or managed
by the service providers (Citrix and AWS here). The AWS specific
implications on the design of your Citrix virtualization system are
minimal, but we’ll walk you through them anyway. Since Citrix Cloud
provides most of the infrastructure and administrative components as a
service, you don’t need to worry about SQL databases, Citrix license
servers, Citrix Director servers and more.

### Control Layer: Hybrid Deployment

Remember that with the hybrid deployment model, you’re going to be
building/managing some of the Citrix virtualization system components,
otherwise it is a greenfield or cloud only deployment by definition\!
The interesting thing here is that, in the context of the Control layer,
they’re pretty much identical.

### Control Layer: Lift and Shift Deployment

With the legacy lift and shift deployment model, you’re deploying all
key control layer components (including Active Directory and all Citrix
session brokering/management components) on AWS. If you have to go down
the “lift and shift” path, it is both a blessing and a curse. It is a
blessing in that most of these considerations have been thoroughly
documented in various published works that are already available. It is
a curse in that you’ll have a lot more work to do both up front and over
time to build, manage, secure, and maintain these components.

If you’re a “lift and shift”er, you’ll want to review and reference the
following before you continue: collectively, they cover most of the
design decisions you’ll need to make to be successful deploying Citrix
on AWS using the lift and shift deployment model:

### Active Directory Considerations

All deployment models for Citrix virtualization systems on AWS require
Microsoft Active Directory. For a compelling user experience, functional
Active Directory services need to be available in every AWS region where
you’ve got VDAs deployed. The structure and complexity of your Active
Directory implementation must be carefully considered, but fortunately
Citrix virtualization can flexibly integrate with a variety of different
AD designs and servicing models.

When deploying Active Directory on AWS, customers can build/maintain
their own Active Directory Domain Controllers using Windows Server
instances, leverage [AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/), or a
combination of the two. Active Directory trusts can also be leveraged to
connect two or more AD forests/domains depending upon the customer’s
needs.

For customers looking to minimize the administrative overhead required
to build and maintain functional Active Directory services, the
[AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) (also known
as AWS Managed Microsoft AD) is an option worth considering. This
service provides you with a fully functional Active Directory
forest/domain without the overhead of building and maintaining Windows
Server VM instances. AWS Managed Microsoft AD is built on highly
available, AWS-managed infrastructure. Each directory is deployed across
multiple Availability Zones, and monitoring automatically detects and
replaces domain controllers that fail. In addition, data replication and
automated daily snapshots are configured for you. You do not have to
install software, and AWS handles all patching and software updates.
With AWS Managed Microsoft AD, you can use native Microsoft
administrative tools, manage Windows machines and users with Microsoft
Group Policy, join EC2 instances and AWS RDS for SQL Server instances to
it, and even setup Active Directory trusts with existing AD instances to
support a variety of complex Enterprise scenarios.

Customers who choose to use the AWS Managed Microsoft AD service with
Citrix virtualization technologies can expect these technologies to just
work with this AWS service, though there are a few important
considerations to consider before doing so. For starters - you won’t
have Domain Administrator, Enterprise Administrator, or other ‘super
user’ type access to the AD instance. You do, however, have full control
of your own container at the root of the directory where you can create
users, computers, groups, OU’s, group policies, etc.

A few other things you CAN NOT do:

-  Create AD objects in any of the default containers (such as
    /Computers): they’re essentially read-only. This brings up a common
    mistake some customers make when using Citrix’s MCS provisioning
    technology: you must choose to create the machine accounts for your
    MCS managed VDA’s in a container/OU that’s writeable - if you don’t
    choose such a location, MCS won’t be able to create the machine
    accounts.
-  Install and configure some AD integrated features such as
    Certificate Services. As such, this impacts customers who will be
    using Citrix’s Federated Authentication Services (“FAS”) technology
    (which requires AD integrated Certificate Services): these customers
    will need to build and manage their own Active Directory on AWS
    using EC2 Windows Server instances.

-  Have local Server Administrator equivalence by default. In an ‘out
    of the box’ Active Directory installation, the Domain Administrators
    group is added to the local Server Administrators group by default.
    If you’re leveraging the AWS Managed Microsoft AD service, you’ll
    need to create your own server administrators’ group, add your own
    users to it, create and apply a group policy to add your group to
    the built-in Server Administrators group on member
    servers/workstations.

While trust relationships, site/service configuration, replication, and
other AD related topics will not be covered in this paper, Citrix has
provided extensive documentation on these topics applicable to all three
deployment models.

***Note:** [AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory](https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/) is a
“Citrix Ready Verified” offering. While not officially supported by
Citrix, the service IS fundamentally native Microsoft Active Directory -
it is just managed by AWS instead of the customer. This AWS service does
have some limitations imposed upon it to deliver it as a service at
scale, and the currently known/most impactful limitations for a Citrix
environment are listed here.*

For more information on Active Directory requirements for greenfield and
hybrid deployments (i.e. environments leveraging Citrix Cloud and the
CVAD Service for session brokering and administration) see
[Citrix Cloud Connector Technical Details](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud-resource-locations/citrix-cloud-connector/technical-details.html).
Besides covering [supported Active Directory functional levels](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud-resource-locations/citrix-cloud-connector/technical-details.html#supported-active-directory-functional-levels),
this article also covers [deployments scenarios for Cloud Connectors in Active Directory](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud-resource-locations/citrix-cloud-connector/technical-details.html#deployment-scenarios-for-cloud-connectors-in-active-directory).

For more information on Active Directory requirements for lift and shift
deployments (i.e. environments leveraging customer managed session
brokering and administration via Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops LTSR
or CR versions) see [CVAD Technical Overview, Active Directory](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/technical-overview/active-directory.html)
and [CVAD System Requirements, Active Directory Functional Levels](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/system-requirements.html#active-directory-functional-levels).

### Session Brokering and Administration Considerations

As you’ve probably already gathered by now, the choice of how you
provide session brokering and administration services is critical, and
has broad reaching implications on overall cost, manageability,
maintenance, and available capabilities for your Citrix virtualization
system. As we’ve already discussed, Citrix recommends the use of the
Citrix Cloud service (CVADS) for this critical component, but for
certain requirements and scenarios, deploying a customer managed session
brokering and administration subsystem (via CVAD LTSR or CR releases)
may be necessary or recommended. The table below highlights some of
these requirements and scenarios for your consideration:

| Attribute/Capability | [Customer Managed](#customer-managed) CVAD (Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, LTSR or CR versions) | [Cloud Service](#cloud-services) CVADS (Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service, provided by Citrix Cloud) |
|---|---|---|
| Requires outbound Internet connectivity to Citrix Cloud. | **NO** - Delivery Controllers don’t require outbound Internet connectivity, though they do need to be able to communicate to AWS infrastructure in order for MCS provisioning to function. | **YES** - Cloud Connectors communicate over the Internet to Citrix Cloud, though these connections can be proxied. See [How to Setup a Proxy Server for Citrix Cloud Connector](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/citrix-cloud-resource-locations/citrix-cloud-connector/proxy-firewall-configuration.html_) for more details. For strictly air gapped deployments, this is often a show stopper. |
| Requires the customer to provide highly available Microsoft SQL database services. | **YES** - CVAD (in both LTSR and CR release types) requires the customer to provide and highly available Microsoft SQL database services. These can be provided by building SQL Servers on EC2 instances, or by leveraging the AWS RDS for SQL Server service. | **NO** - CVADS does not require customers to touch SQL server: highly available database services are provided by the Citrix Cloud delivery platform and are transparent to customers. |
| Requires the customer to apply patches and upgrades to Citrix software over time to maintain security and supportability, as well as get access to new features and capabilities. | **YES** - customers are responsible for installation, configuration, patching, upgrading, etc. both Citrix software and underlying operating system for all components in a CVAD based session brokering and administration system. They’re also responsible for maintaining high availability of each component, including Citrix Delivery Controllers, Studio installations, Director, and Citrix Licensing. | **NO** - Cloud Connectors (the only session brokering and administrative component that resides in the customer’s VPC) are automatically updated and maintained by Citrix. Customers are responsible for patching and maintaining the Windows Server operating system on the EC2 Cloud Connector instances, and new features and capabilities are available immediately, without requiring the customer to manually update the Cloud Connectors. |
| Ability to leverage advanced services provided by Citrix Cloud, including the [Citrix Autoscale feature](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/autoscale.html). | **Sometimes** - not all advanced services are available to customer managed CVAD deployments, and when they are, may require the installation and/or configuration of additional components. The autoscale feature is not available for CVAD environments. | **YES** - CVADS is designed to work ‘out of the box’ with other Citrix Cloud services, and in most cases these services are pre-configured so the customer simply turns them on. The [Autoscale feature](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/autoscale.html), which provides the ability to granularly control the quantity and power state of VDA’s, is particularly impactful for VDA deployments on public cloud. It can provide substantial infrastructure cost savings in scenarios where you’re paying for only the capacity you need. |
| Ability to have complete control over all subsystem components, including timing of upgrade and maintenance activities. | **YES** - since every component is installed, configured, and maintained by the customer, the customer has complete control over the versioning, configuration, and availability of each component (albeit at substantially increased cost of infrastructure, complexity, and administrative overhead). | **NO** - with CVADS, customers give up some measure of control, but gain simplicity, reduced infrastructure costs, and substantially reduced administrative overhead. |
| Ability to license based on concurrent users vs. named users. | **YES** - CVAD can be licensed by CCU. | **Not Yet** - CVADS is currently licensed by named user only. CCU licensing is being considered for future releases, but this feature has not been committed as of the time of writing. |

### Cloud Connectors, Delivery Controllers, and Resource Locations

Since both greenfield and hybrid models leverage cloud services (CVADS)
for session brokering and administration, you deploy Cloud Connectors to
create a [resource location](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/install-configure/resource-location.html)
in each region where you plan to host VDA’s. When you create a resource
location in a region, you build a highly available configuration by
deploying **n+1** Cloud Connector instances and spreading the Cloud
Connectors across Availability Zones in that region. Cloud Connectors
are typically placed in separate private subnets from the VDAs to
simplify security policy application, and the Cloud Connector instances
must have outbound Internet access to facilitate connecting to Citrix
Cloud. Placing them in a separate subnet from VDAs allows administrators
to apply different routing policies to the two different resource types.

![Diagram 13: CVADS Resource Location design pattern with separate subnets for VDA’s and Cloud Connectors](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_013.png)

*Diagram 13: CVADS Resource Location design pattern with separate subnets for VDA’s and Cloud Connectors.*

The same general concepts apply when we're talking about Delivery Controllers (CVAD), though we use the term zone vs. resource location in the customer managed brokering subsystem. Also note that Cloud Connector instances on EC2 are great candidates for
reserved pricing since they’ll be running any time the system needs to
be up. See [this article](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/install-configure/install-cloud-connector/cc-scale-and-size.html)
for more information about sizing Cloud Connector instances.

### Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Site Design Considerations

#### Resource Locations and Zones

Using [Citrix zones](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/zones.html)
(not to be confused with Availability Zones) can help users in remote
regions connect to resources without necessarily forcing their
connections to traverse large segments of the WAN. In a Citrix Virtual
Apps and Desktops Service environment, each resource location is
considered a zone. When you create a resource location and install a
Cloud Connector, a zone is automatically created for you. Each zone can
have a different set of resources, based on your unique needs and
environment. For more information on zones, see the following
[link](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops-service/manage-deployment/zones.html).

#### Machine Catalogs, Delivery Groups, and Resource Locations

Citrix administrators should ensure that VDAs are also spread across
Availability Zones (AZ). An AWS Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with
redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region - a
physical location around the world where AWS cluster data centers. A
virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network which spans all of the
Availability Zones in the Region. Subnets are a required sub-component
of a VPC, and virtual network interfaces are each attached to a single
subnet. Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone
and cannot span zones. By launching VDAs in separate Availability Zones,
you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location.
See [What is a Amazon VPC?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html)
for more information. To ensure VDAs are spread between AZs you can
create a Machine Catalog per AZ (using one Host Connection per AZ) which
then can map to a single Delivery Group.

#### Provisioning in AWS: Machine Creation Services

Starting with the release of CVAD 1811,
role-based authentication can be used when
creating a host connection for [MCS provisioning in
AWS](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2019/02/04/role-based-authentication-for-citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-in-aws/).
An IAM role or IAM user account associated with a Delivery Controller or
Cloud Connector on an EC2 instance can be used in the place of a user’s
secret key and API key, enabling increased security, delegated
administrative rights, and PKI-based environments with temporary
credentials and session tokens. To configure a host connection using
role-based authentication, first create an IAM role with the permissions
described in
[CTX140429](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX140429).
[Associate this role with an EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/assign-iam-role-ec2-instance/) with a CVAD 1811+ Delivery Controller or a Cloud Connector.
On versions of CVAD earlier than 1811, admins must provide the API Key
(Access Key) and Secret Key of an IAM user in order to create a host
connection. The following
[article](https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/flexing-to-the-cloud-with-citrix-xendesktop-and-amazon-web-services.pdf)
describes how to configure a host connection this way.

After creating the host connection, create a machine catalog as
described
[here](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-virtual-apps-desktops/install-configure/machine-catalogs-create.html)
using an AMI created from the master VDA image in AWS. For more details
about MCS in AWS, see the following articles:
[Citrix MCS on AWS Deep Dive 1](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX241160) and
[How MCS works after pooled VMs are created in AWS](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX234562).

Another item that should be considered when deploying VDAs in AWS using
MCS is [EBS Volume initialization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-initialize.html)
(also known as pre-warming or hydration). For volumes that were restored
from snapshots, the storage blocks must be pulled down from Amazon S3
and written to the volume before you can access them. This preliminary
action takes time and can cause a significant increase in the latency of
I/O operations the first time each block is accessed. Volume performance
is achieved after all blocks have been downloaded and written to the
volume. Please see [Initializing Amazon EBS Volumes on Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ebs-initialize.html)
for AWS recommended steps to Initialize Amazon EBS Volumes on Windows
instances and see [Initializing Amazon EBS Volumes on Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-initialize.html)
for Linux instances.

Please see the [Infrastructure (or Platform) Layer Considerations](#operations-layer-considerations) for
details on VPC design as it relates to MCS.

#### Troubleshooting Machine Creation Services

This section lists some common issues and associated recommendations/resolution links.

-  Some newer AWS instance types will not show up by default in the Machine
Catalog creation wizard in Studio (either CVAD or CVADS). The UI is
populated with instance types from a static XML file which resides on
Delivery Controllers (CVAD) or Cloud Connectors (CVADS). This XML can be
modified to include newer instance types, but this file is overwritten
with default values during upgrades (both Citrix initiated Cloud
Connector updates or customer-initiated Delivery Controller upgrades).
See [Updating AWS Instance Types for XenDesktop](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX139707)

types.

## Infrastructure (or Platform) Layer Considerations

In the Citrix Architectural Design Framework, the Infrastructure (or
Platform) layer defines the physical elements where the Citrix workloads
run. In this document, that of course refers to AWS. AWS provides a
broad variety of cloud services (165+\!) and is both the oldest and
largest of the Hyperscale Cloud providers in existence today. It was
also the first public cloud supported by Citrix virtualization
technology, and is a compelling option for new or existing Citrix
customers looking to move existing or run new Citrix virtualization
workloads in ‘the Cloud’.

### Infrastructure as Code and the AWS Object Model

To understand how Citrix virtualization technologies are integrated with
and run on top of AWS, it is useful to start with a basic understanding
of the object model behind some of their key/relevant services. This
also allows us to describe the AWS platform in terms that are familiar
to most IT professionals. To facilitate this understanding, we’ll refer
to the following diagram which represents the design pattern for a CVADS
resource location on AWS:

![Diagram 14: Deployed "Resource Location" architecture/design pattern from the Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS Quick Start Cloud Formation template](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_014.png)

*Diagram 14: Deployed “Resource Location” architecture/design pattern
from the [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-virtual-apps/) Quick Start Cloud Formation template.*

This design pattern is the foundation of most Citrix virtualization
system architectures on AWS. It is also not just one ‘big’ pattern - it
is built on a number of different, well maintained and documented design
patterns for Enterprise IT on AWS. These patterns are represented,
documented, and reproduced using [AWS Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates. AWS
provides a library of [Quick Start templates](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/) which can be run
as-is, layered together (‘nested’) with other templates, and even
duplicated and customized for your own specific needs. This highlights a
couple of the other major advantages of public cloud infrastructure:
infrastructure as code, and the ‘pay as you go’ nature of many cloud
services. We’ll dig more deeply into infrastructure as code in the
Citrix virtualization world shortly, but we’ll emphasize the point with
a quick touchpoint that will likely resonate for the expected readers of
this paper: for many enterprise IT architects, having access to such a
vast library of services, design patterns, and technology tools at your
fingertips is awesome. Combined with the ability to pay for resources as
you consume them and simply remove them when you’re done? This is a very
powerful way to learn about and/or evaluate new stuff, and it makes the
ROI for at scale investments much easier to understand and communicate\!

Back to the AWS object model for a moment: the top level object in
diagram 14 is the [AWS Region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/).
You can think of AWS regions as clusters of well-connected but
strategically separated data centers called
[Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/).
Each region will typically include 2 or more Availability Zones, which
consist of one or more physical buildings with redundant power,
networking, and connectivity. As of the time of this writing, AWS has 23
regions globally, which consist of 69 availability zones, but it is
important to note that they’re constantly investing in new regions and
AZ’s. These numbers, while staggering to most of us, are likely already
outdated by the time you read this\! This highlights one of the other
benefits of moving to public cloud infrastructure on AWS: you continue
to benefit from the investments they’re making (on a scale well beyond
the reach of most IT organizations or even governments) over time. This
continuous evolution/improvement, while daunting for change-averse IT
organizations and business cultures, provides a broad reaching set of
empowering benefits for Enterprise IT as it adapts to this ‘new’ model.

AWS region adoption choices are often based upon proximity, services
available, cost, compliance, and/or SLA. While choosing the right
region(s) for your Citrix virtualization system is beyond the scope of
this document, consider at least the following when making your
choice(s):

-  If you have one or more existing, customer managed data centers
    you’ll be connecting to AWS, consider the region(s) which provides
    the lowest latency network connectivity to your datacenters and/or
    major offices.
-  All regions may not have the AWS services or instance types you’re
    looking for. AWS deploys new services or instance types initially to
    a few main regions, then expands to the rest over time.
    Additionally, newer regions may not have older instance types - do
    your research before you build whenever possible\!
-  CVAD sites and CVADS resource locations are realistically bound to a
    specific region. High availability for individual components of a
    site/resource location (such as cloud connectors, StoreFront
    servers, and/or ADC/Gateway VPX instances) is accomplished by
    placing resources in multiple availability zones in a given region.
-  Don’t go overboard spreading your infrastructure across regions:
    while it is extremely easy to do on AWS, consider cost and
    complexity relative to the payoff you expect before you scale any
    system. You do end up paying for network traffic and storage traffic
    as well in some cases. The costs can be trivial for traffic while it
    is local to a region, but goes up when the traffic traverses regions
    and/or the Internet.

Stepping up a layer in Diagram 14 now, let’s look at some of the
networking constructs in this design pattern. The primary network
construct on AWS is the VPC or “Virtual Private Cloud”. VPC’s are a
regional construct (i.e. they span AZ’s) - you will have at least one
VPC in each region you deploy Citrix virtualization tech into. VPC’s
have a CIDR block of IP addresses defined, which will need to be unique
if your network design routes traffic between multiple VPC’s. VPC’s are
further broken down into subnets, and subnets are tied to an AZ (ie they
do NOT span AZ’s in a region).

Subnets also have different attributes and/or objects associated with
them, including routing policies and security policies. This is why the
design patterns highlighted in this document (and other Citrix
documentation) recommend putting VDA’s in separate subnets from Cloud
Connectors - so you can assign different routing and security policies
to VDA’s and Cloud Connectors.

Outbound Internet access from any subnet in a VPC (a regional construct)
can be handled many different ways, but a common method is leveraging
[NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html)
to provide Internet connectivity to private subnets. Public subnets are
often served by [Internet Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html),
which facilitate routing of inbound connections to services you make
accessible from the Internet.

Subnets are also commonly labeled as ‘public’ and ‘private’. A pubic
subnet is a subnet with Internet routable IP addresses assigned (in
addition to the private IP addresses) and is associated with a route
table that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) for both inbound and
outbound Internet traffic. A private subnet is a subnet with only
private IP addresses assigned, and is associated with a route table that
has a route for outbound internet access through a NAT Gateway or NAT
Instances which reside in a pubic subnet. In a Citrix virtualization
system, the Gateway vServer (VIP) usually
resides in a public subnet
since it accepts inbound connections from client devices over the
Internet and is used to securely proxy Citrix virtualization traffic
into private subnets in a VPC.

There are many ways to build networks on AWS, with a lot of innovative
features/techniques available that you can’t get elsewhere. We’re not
going to introduce you to them all here, but two tools/techniques worth
looking into are [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)
and [transit gateways](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/). These two
constructs will help introduce you to routing traffic between VPC’s
simply ([VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html))
or in a more Enterprise ready, hybrid cloud friendly model
([transit gateways](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/)).

There’s obviously much more we could dig into here, and for the curious
and motivated, there’s a mountain of public domain knowledge available
at your fingertips to learn more\! For now, let’s bring this back around
to design patterns underneath all the diagrams you’ve seen in this
paper.

One of the compelling attributes of the AWS platform is that it has been
built on publicly consumable API’s. Why is this compelling? For one
thing, this means that pretty much any type of infrastructure component
you can run on AWS can be **reproducibly built from code**. When
combined with a powerful and comprehensive deployment service such as
[AWS Cloud Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/), customers
have a powerful framework for learning about, customizing, deploying,
and managing IT systems. The concept of
[Infrastructure as Code](https://infrastructure-as-code.com/) may be new and/or
perplexing for many traditional Enterprise focused technologists, but it
can be transformational once adopted and practiced.

As we mentioned earlier, AWS provides a library of Cloud Formation based
[Quick Start templates](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/) which can be run
as-is, layered together (‘nested’) with other templates, and even
duplicated and customized for your own specific needs. This library of
templates is managed and maintained by AWS, in cooperation with
technology partners such as Citrix, and these templates are often open
sourced (meaning they can be duplicated and modified as needed). As of
the time of writing, the following Quick Start templates are available
for Citrix technologies on AWS:

-  [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-virtual-apps/) - deploys a highly available Citrix Cloud Virtual Apps and Desktops
    Service “Resource Location” on AWS.
-  [Citrix ADC for Web Applications](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-adc-vpx/) - deploys highly available Citrix ADC VPX instances on AWS. While
    the use case focus differs slightly, this design pattern is
    functional and relevant for Citrix Gateway deployments with
    CVAD/CVADS also. Citrix and AWS are working on an additional Quick
    Start for this specific use case.

We’ve already discussed how the “Citrix ADC for Web Applications” design
pattern relates to the CVADS resource location design pattern in the
“Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS” template, so let’s
break down a couple foundational templates that underlie both. For
simplicity, we’ll call it the “CVADS template”.

If we open the CVADS QuickStart template in the Cloud Formation
Designer, we get a visual representation of this template. From this
visual, we can see that this template utilizes three separate “nested”
stacks or templates:

![Diagram 15: CVADS template in Cloud Formation Designer with nested stacks](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_015.png)

*Diagram 15: CVADS template in Cloud Formation Designer with nested stacks.*

In Diagram 15, CitrixResourceLocationStack is ‘on top’, and the other
three stacks nested underneath it are foundational stacks, managed and
maintained by AWS.

[The "VPCStack" template](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/)
lays down the bulk of the networking foundation underneath the CVADS
template. VPCStack is responsible for building the following components
of the CVADS stack diagram. All other stacks build on top of these
resources and parameters:

![Diagram 16: VPCStack sample build results](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_016.png)

*Diagram 16: VPCStack sample build results.*

On top of VPCStack comes the RDGWStack and ADStack. The
[RDGWStack template](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/rd-gateway/)
lays down the infrastructure to provide administrative remote console
access to the network built by VPCStack. It is depicted in Orange in
Diagram 17 below. The [ADStack template](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/active-directory-ds/),
which runs in parallel to RDGWStack, creates the Active Directory
infrastructure for a system. It includes options for creating AD on IaaS
instances and also using the AWS Active Directory service. For our
example design pattern below, it is building the AD DS Service object in
red:

![Diagram 17: VPStack + RDGWStack + ADStack sample build results](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops-on-aws_017.png)

*Diagram 17: VPStack + RDGWStack + ADStack sample build results.*

Finally, CitrixResourceLocationStack (the ‘master’ stack, which calls
the three nested stacks) runs, building on top of the three foundation
stacks. It is responsible for creating the Cloud Connectors, and VDA on
AWS, and it leverages Citrix Cloud API’s to create the resource
location, hosting connection, machine catalog, delivery group, etc. in
your Citrix Cloud tenant. The end result? A fully functional Citrix
Cloud resource location running on AWS:

### Summary - Understanding Design Patterns for Citrix on AWS

Confused yet? If so, don’t be alarmed: this may well be the start of
your Citrix on AWS public cloud journey, and we’ve merely skimmed the
surface of many deep topics here. Hopefully, however, we’ve successfully
illustrated the following salient points:

-  Infrastructure as Code is a powerful concept that can revolutionize
    the way complete systems are designed, built, and maintained.
-  When deploying systems on AWS’ public cloud, different components of
    any given solution can be represented by code, and built on-demand
    using AWS Cloud Formation and other technologies.
-  These components are represented by stack templates when using AWS
    Cloud Formation, and templates can be version managed, copied,
    modified, etc. as needed to achieve the desired results.
-  Templates can be nested, building complete systems (such as a fully
    functioning CVADS resource location on AWS) from the individual
    design patterns (templates).
-  The [Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/citrix-virtual-apps/)
    Quick Start template is built upon three AWS managed/maintained
    foundation templates, which are very well documented. Start with the
    links below to learn more about each:
    -  The VPCStack template:
    [https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/vpc/)
    -  The RDGWStack template:
    [https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/rd-gateway/](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/rd-gateway/)
    -  The ADStack template:
    [https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/active-directory-ds/](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/active-directory-ds/)
-  By leveraging templates and performing trial builds, an Enterprise
    technologist can learn about, evaluate, and design systems that meet
    the specific needs of their organization or customer.

## Operations Layer Considerations

This section defines the operational activities that administrators will
perform on a periodic basis. Many of these are not specific to AWS, and
are detailed in existing published documentation. Below we’ve summarized
some of the more important and/or AWS specific tasks, but please refer
to the [Monitor topic](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/citrix-vdi-best-practices/monitor.html)
in Citrix product documentation for more information.

### On-Demand Tasks

The following table outlines the tasks that are expected to be performed
on-demand based on application requirements and troubleshooting efforts.

| Component | Task | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Generic | Update Knowledge Base | When the Citrix Team troubleshoots issues related to the environment, they should identify solutions to problems. KBA should be created for each issue to help support future troubleshooting activities. |
| Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Modify Image | Images should be updated as required to support requests. The updates will likely be monthly, but more frequent updates may be required for testing. |
| Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Publish Image | When images are modified, they are usually tested and published. |
| AWS | Verify instance launch | When a new instance is launched via MCS, verify that the instance has been created in the AWS console, and that there are available IPs in the pool for the given VPC. MCS-provisioned machines will not be created if there are no available IPs in the VPC pool. |
| AWS | Verify on-prem image efficacy | An instance created from any on-prem image should be tested for launchability and viability before being used to update production instances. |
| AWS | Modify IAM user/ group permissions | As needed, IAM user and group permissions should be reviewed to reduce the amount of users with administrative access and to implement the “least privilege” methodology. |
| AWS | Modify Security Groups | As needed, Security Groups should be reviewed to grant or remove access for different traffic protocols from various IPs or IP ranges. Ingress and egress rules should be modified to implement network traffic lockdowns. |
| AWS and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Update machines in a Machine Catalog   | As needed, update machine images to include any necessary modifications. A new AMI must be created of the modified image, and used to update the Machine Catalog. See Update and Upgrade Process section below for more details. |
| AWS and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Roll back updates to a Machine Catalog | As needed, in the case that a machine image must be rolled back, a previous AMI with the last known working configuration can be used to update machines in the Machine Catalog. |

### Daily Periodic Tasks

The following table outlines the tasks that should be performed daily.

| Component | Task | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Generic | Review Citrix Director, Windows Performance Monitor, Event Log, and other monitoring software alerts | Check for warnings or alerts within Citrix Director, event logs, or other monitoring software. Investigate the root cause of the alert if any. **Note:** A computer and monitor can be set up to display the Citrix Director dashboard to create a heads-up display for the Citrix department so that the status of the environment is clearly visible. Monitoring recommendations for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops are included in the [Monitoring](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/citrix-vdi-best-practices/monitor.html) section of the Virtual Apps and Desktops Best Practices guide. |
| Generic | Verify backups completed successfully | Verify all scheduled backups have been completed successfully. This can include but is not limited to user data (user profiles / home folders), application data, Citrix databases, Citrix StoreFront configuration, Citrix license files. |
| Generic | Test environment access | Simulate a connection both internally and externally to validate that desktop and application resources are available before most users log on for the day. This should be tested throughout the day and may even be automated. |
| Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Virtual machine power checking | Verify that the appropriate number of idle desktops and application servers are powered on and registered with the Delivery Controllers to confirm availability for user workloads. |
| AWS | Perform checks for instance health | Check the AWS console to verify the state of the instances and underlying hardware. All instances should pass the two health checks when powered on. |
| Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Perform incremental backup of Citrix-related databases | Perform incremental-data backups of the following Citrix databases: Site Database, Configuration Logging Database, Monitoring Database |

### Weekly Periodic Tasks

The following table outlines the tasks that should be performed on a
weekly basis.

| Component | Task | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Generic | Review latest hotfixes and patches | Review, test, and deploy the latest Citrix [hotfixes](http://support.citrix.com/product/xd/) and ascertain whether the Delivery Controllers and Server-Based OS / Desktop-Based OS virtual machines require them. For Microsoft updates deployed via SCCM or WSUS to machines in AWS, all machines will receive these updates when powered on. If Citrix Power Management is employed, there may be machines in the Machine Catalog that are not regular turned on. When performing image updates, it is best to use a dynamic master instance that is powered on during all update cycles. AMIs can then be created from this instance and include all necessary patches. **Note:** Any required hotfixes should be tested using the recommended testing process prior to implementation in Production. |
| Generic | Create Citrix environment status report | Create a report on overall environment performance (server health, resource usage, user experience) and number of Citrix issues (close rate, open issues, and so on). |
| Generic | Review status report | Review Citrix status report to identify any trends or common issues. |
| Generic | Maintain internal support knowledge base | Create KBA and issue resolution scripts to address Level-1 and Level-2 support requests. | Review KBA and issue resolution scripts for accuracy, compliance, and feasibility. |
| Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Check Configuration Logging reports | Confirm that Citrix Site-wide changes implemented during the previous week were approved through change control. |
| Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops | Perform full backup of Citrix-related databases | Perform full-data backups of the following Citrix databases: Site Database, Configuration Logging Database, Monitoring Database. |
| AWS | Perform snapshots of all EBS volumes | All Elastic Block Storage volumes should be snapshotted on a periodic basis. Snapshots can be managed and groomed in the AWS EC2 console. |

### Monthly Periodic Tasks

The following table outlines the tasks that should be performed on a
monthly basis.

| Component | Task | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Generic | Perform capacity assessment | Conduct environment performance and capacity assessment of the Citrix environment to determine environment utilization and any scalability requirements. Review monthly reports from monitoring tools to assess environment performance and capacity, including, but not limited to: Virtual server compute (CPU and RAM) allocation, Licensing, Network bandwidth. Procure software and/or licenses and build additional servers as needed. **Note:** Recommendations for performing a capacity assessment are included in [Decision: Capacity Management](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/xenapp-and-xendesktop/7-15-ltsr/citrix-vdi-best-practices/monitor.html#decision-capacity-management) in the Monitoring section of the Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop Best Practices guide.|
| Generic | Review elevated privilege access | Review which users and groups have elevated permissions to the environment and assess whether ongoing elevated access is required. Remove any accounts that no longer require these administrative rights. Primarily only IAM users and roles should be used to assign elevated privileges, with tightly restricted access to individual user, local, or root accounts. |

### Yearly Periodic Tasks

The following table outlines the tasks that should be performed on a
yearly basis.

| Component | Task | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| Generic | Conduct Citrix policy assessment | Review Citrix policies and determine whether new policies are required and existing policies need to be updated. |
| Generic | Review software upgrades | Review and assess the requirement for new Citrix software releases or versions. |
| Generic | Perform Business Continuity Plan (BCP)/ Disaster Recovery (DR) test | Conduct functional BCP/DR test to confirm DR readiness. This plan should include a yearly restore test to validate the actual restore process from backup data is functioning correctly. |
| Generic | Perform application assessment | Review the usage of applications outside and within the Citrix environment. Assess the validity of adding additional applications to the Citrix Site, removing applications that are no longer required, or upgrading the applications to the latest version. |
| AWS | Assess Network Security Group Accesses | As features or applications are added or removed from the Citrix infrastructure servers or application servers, the Network Security Groups associated with those instances should also be assessed and modified if necessary, to add or remove any ports or protocols. |
