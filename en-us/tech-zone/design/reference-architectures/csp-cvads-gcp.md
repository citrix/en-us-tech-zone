# Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service – GCP Implementation with Managed Microsoft Active Directory for CSPs

## Contributors

**Author:** [JP Alfaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jp-alfaro-b2bb03b2/)

## Architecture

GCP’s Managed Service for Microsoft Active Directory is a fully managed service on the Google Cloud Platform. The service automatically deploys and manages highly available Active Directory domain controllers on your GCP project in an isolated VPC network. Domain controller access is restricted, and you can only manage your domain by deploying management instances with Remote Server Administration tools. A VPC peering is deployed automatically with the service for your AD-dependent workloads to reach Active Directory. Additionally, Google Cloud DNS is configured to forward all DNS queries to the Managed Microsoft AD.
For this implementation, we are following Google's Active Directory resource forest architecture with a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service multitenant environment.

## Citrix and GCP Services

### Initial Assumptions

#### Google Cloud Platform

*  A GCP subscription is available and billing has been configured
*  GCP Cloud Identity has been configured (pre-requisite to deploy a GCP organization)
*  An organization has been configured along with a folder to deploy the test/dev GCP projects to be utilized. Check this link to learn more about:

[GCP Resource Hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy)

*  The following GCP APIs are enabled:
    *  Compute Engine API
    *  Cloud Resource Manager API
    *  Identity and Access Management (IAM) API
    *  Cloud Build API
*  A GCP project is deployed with 2 subnets:
    *  Resources subnet: resources subnet to deploy the Managed Microsoft AD service, and the Citrix Cloud Connectors, Master Images, and VDAs. Most of the configurations is performed on this project
    *  AD management subnet:  management subnet dedicated to instances utilized to manage Active Directory through the Remote Server Administration Tools
*  Managed Microsoft AD service is deployed:
    *  Completely managed by GCP
    *  Deploys its own subnet, which is not viewable through the GCP console
    *  A VPC peering is deployed automatically with the service for connectivity from your GCP projects
    *  Google Cloud DNS is configured to forward all DNS queries to the managed domain controllers

### Citrix Cloud

*  A Citrix Cloud subscription is available
*  Citrix Cloud Connector is deployed
*  VDA master image is deployed
*  Google Cloud Platform hosting connection is configured
*  Machine Catalog and Delivery Group is configured

### GCP Terminology

The following are the most common GCP terms you need to understand, as described on the GCP documentation:

*  Organizations: Organizations represent the root node in the GCP resource hierarchy, to create an organization, GCP Cloud Identity, or G-Suite is required. An organization is not required for this implementation, but it is highly recommended to deploy one for your production environments to properly organize your resources.
*  Folders: Folders are utilized to organize resources within GCP, they can contain more folders, or projects. For example, you can create folders to separate projects by department, environment type, etc. A folder is not required for this implementation, but in general terms, they are recommended for proper resource organization.
*  Projects: A project provides an abstract grouping of resources within GCP, all resources in this deployment must belong to a GCP project. Under normal circumstances, VM instances from one project cannot communicate with VM instances on another project, unless Shared VPC is utilized. Shared VPCs are not currently supported by Citrix Cloud.
*  Billing Accounts: Billing accounts represent the payment profile to be utilized to pay for GCP consumption. A billing account can be linked to multiple projects, but a project can only be linked to a single billing account.
*  IAM: GCP’s Identity and Access Management platform. It is utilized to grant user permissions to perform actions on GCP resources. This platform is also utilized to deploy and manage Service Accounts. We utilize IAM to configure various permissions.
*  Service Account: a service account is a GCP account that is not connected to an actual user, but instead represents a VM instance or an application. Service accounts can be granted permissions to perform different actions on the various GCP APIs. A service account is created to connect Citrix Cloud to GCP and enable Machine Creation Services.
*  GCE: Google Compute Engine, this is the GCP platform in which you deploy compute resources, including VM instances, disks, instance templates, instance groups, etc.
*  GCE Instance: A VM deployed on the GCE platform. We deploy GCE instances for Cloud Connectors, master image, the AD management VM, etc. All machines created through a Citrix machine catalog are deployed as GCE instances.
*  Instance Template: A “baseline” resource you can utilize to deploy VMs and instance groups in GCP. The Citrix MCS process copies the master image into an instance template, which is utilized to deploy catalog machines.
*  VPC Network: GCP’s virtual network object. VPCs in GCP are global, meaning you can deploy subnets to a VPC from each GCP region. You can deploy VPCs in auto-mode, which creates all subnets and CIDR ranges automatically, or custom-mode, which lets you create subnets and CIDR ranges manually. Non-overlapping VPCs from different projects can be connected through a VPC peering.
*  Shared VPC: A shared VPC can be spanned across multiple projects, eliminating the requirement to create separate VPCs for each project, or the utilization of VPC peerings.
*  VPC Peering: A VPC peering allows you to connect VPCs which would otherwise be disconnected. In this implementation, the GCP Managed Microsoft AD service creates a VPC peering automatically to connect our VPC to the managed AD service VPC.
*  Cloud DNS: GCP service utilized to manage DNS zones and records. With the creation of the Managed Microsoft AD service, Cloud DNS is automatically configured to forward DNS queries to the managed domain controllers.

## Implementation

## Google Components

### Create the GCP main project

*  On the GCP console, click Select a project.

Considerations:

*  A project might already be selected, so the menu shows the name of your current project instead of Select a project.
*  As recommended by Google, for production environments you should be protecting your projects against accidental deletion.
*  On the projects window, click NEW PROJECT.

[![CSP-Image-004](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_004.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_004.png)

*  On the New Project screen, enter the following information:
    *  Project name: must be unique
    *  Billing account: the billing account to use for this project
    *  Organization: your GCP organization
    *  Location: Folder under which to deploy the project

    [![CSP-Image-005](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_005.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_005.png)

*  Delete the main project default VPC
*  On the navigation menu, go to VPC Network > VPC Networks and select your default VPC.

[![CSP-Image-006](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_006.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_006.png)

#### Considerations

*  When a new project is created, a default VPC (auto-mode) is automatically created, we will create a new VPC soon.
*  On the VPC network details screen, click DELETE VPC NETWORK and then DELETE.

[![CSP-Image-7](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_007.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_007.png)

#### Create a new custom-mode VPC

*  On the navigation menu, go to VPC Network > VPC Networks and click Create VPC network.

[![CSP-Image-8](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_008.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_008.png)

Considerations:

*  Auto-mode VPCs automatically create a subnet on each GCP region and assign an RFC 1918 CIDR range.
*  Custom-mode VPCs allow you to create your subnets and CIDR ranges as required.
*  On the Subnets section, create 2 subnets, these is utilized by the Citrix instances, and the AD management servers.

Considerations:

*  Since this is a testing environment, we are allowing inbound RDP, SSH, and ICMP from any external network, for production environments, set up the firewall rules appropriately to ensure only authorized users / networks can access the instances.
*  On the Create a firewall rule screen, enter the following information:
    *  Name: firewall rule name
    *  Description: firewall rule description
    *  Network: shared VPC network
    *  Priority: rule priority

[![CSP-Image-13](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_013.png)](/en-us/tech-zone/design/media/reference-architectures_csp-cvads-gcp_013.png)

Considerations:

*  Managed domain controllers are deployed with the ADDS and DNS roles.
*  As explained previously, the domain controllers are not accessible or appear on the instance list on Compute Engine.
*  We will create a management VM for Active Directory shortly.
*  On the Create a new domain screen, enter the following information:
    *  FQDN: Domain FQDN
    *  NetBIOS: is automatically populated
    *  Select networks: networks that will have access to the service, in this case we are choosing our shared VPC
    *  CIDR Range: a /24 CIDR range for the VPC where the domain controllers is deployed, it must not overlap with your current subnets

Considerations:

*  The delegated admin account is utilized to manage AD objects, add additional administrators, etc.
*  The delegated administrator account resides on the Users container within AD, you can reset its password directly in the ADUC console, but you cannot move the object to another OU.
*  The delegated administrator account has access to the following OUs:
    *  Cloud: Full control
    *  Cloud Service Objects: very limited update permissions
*  When joining a computer to the domain, the AD account is created under the Cloud > Computers OU, not the default Computers container.
*  Service creation can take up to 60 minutes.
*  Once creation is finalized, select your domain and click SET PASSWORD.
