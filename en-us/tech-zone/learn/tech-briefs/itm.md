# Introduction to Citrix Intelligent Traffic Management

Citrix Intelligent Traffic Management (ITM) service brings “intelligence” to the Internet standard of Domain Name Server (DNS). This service is done by incorporating a broad set of capabilities that determine the best query response based on the analysis of real time conditions.

![Introduction to ITM](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_introa1.png)

## ITM Overview

Today Citrix customers have a great amount of control and visibility over their users’ endpoints and internet facing apps. This visibility is in addition to their back-end systems and services, irrespective of the type of cloud environment they’re hosted in. However, they lack visibility into the internet across which those applications and services are delivered. The ITM solution eliminates this internet “blind-spot” primarily in two ways.

First it provides **Visualization** of the performance of the tens of thousands of autonomous networks across the internet. Including sites where an ITM customer’s internet applications and services are hosted including ISPs, Content Delivery Networks (CDN), Public or Private Clouds. Also, it provides robust **Optimization** by analyzing a performance database composed of a vast set of Real-time User Measurements (RUM). These measurements determine the optimal response to DNS queries initiated by a users’ browser or application.

![ITM Visualization and Optimization](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_overviewa2.png)

Citrix ITM, hosted in Citrix Cloud, comprises of several components that together provide the optimal response to DNS queries. Data is collected from various sources including from RUM or through APIs to third party platforms to fuel decisions.

Customers can benefit from its intelligent DNS decisions by pointing their website domain records to ITM through a CNAME record. ITM can also act as the authoritative DNS for the domains delivered by any of the nearly 100 Name Servers (NS) around the world. Internet service users are directed to target sites according to the desired mix of several metric options such as cost, proximity, or throughput.

With all of the data, ITM provides intelligent decision responses that can’t be achieved with other DNS systems. Therefore, ITM customers can provide their users with maximum experience for minimal cost.

![How DNS Works](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_inserta3.png)

## ITM Optimization

ITM Optimization is based on the orchestration of several components. These components provide users of ITM customer websites and services with the optimal response to DNS queries based on desired selection criteria.

![ITM Components](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizea4.png)

*  **Radar** - Java script downloaded from ITM customer sites captures internet performance data through a unique tag.
*  **Openmix** - Analyzes performance data to determine the optimal response to DNS queries.
*  **Predictive DNS** - Configure DNS records (A, MX, and so forth.) and map records to Openmix decisions.
*  **Sonar** - Global website synthetic monitoring with http/https probes used for Openmix decisions.
*  **Fusion** – Provides 3rd party performance data such as Citrix ADC load balancing metrics.
*  **Platforms** – Identifies ISPs, CDNs, and Public or Private Clouds used as measurement destinations for Openmix analysis.

![Radar](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/radar.html) is a unique ITM differentiator whereby a Java script tag is embedded in the index page(s) of ITM customer websites. Site users download Radar to measure performance data for the customer sites along with other public ITM sites. The Radar database receives its input through Billions of users making Billions of measurements daily from global networks.

Below we see an example tag add at the end of the body of an IIS website start page.

![Radar Tag](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizec6.png)

After being downloaded the Radar Java Script captures performance data from site visitor endpoints. By default, it waits 2 seconds after the initial page load to run and take measurements to avoid performance impact. The script communicates with the ITM service to determine what types of queries to use for response time and throughput.

Citrix ITM agents are hosted in a select set of public community sites where queries are made to both the ITM customers' private websites or services. By default, a 43-byte image is downloaded, but larger images can be used to extrapolate more accurate bandwidth estimates.

Below we see browsing to a workspacedemo.net site with activity logged in Chrome developer tools. Quickly after the main page is loaded, and radar.js is downloaded, we see the series of queries it makes such as one to “level3.cedexis-test.com”. We also see the responses it receives including a 100KB iceberg image.

![Radar Performance Measurement](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimized7.png)

All data is stored in ITM’s global Radar database and mapped to the Autonomous System. Here, the browser’s endpoint’s public IP address is hosted. We see that other components use this data to provide the Visualization and Optimization to eliminate the Internet blind-spot.

![Openmix](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizee8.png)
 [Openmix](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/openmix.html) gathers and analyzes internet performance data. Openmix is the heart of ITM and brings together all the data it captures to formulate the most “intelligent” DNS response based on the desired selection requirements. It obtains input from several ITM components:

*  **Radar** – provides the private and public community performance database utilized by Openmix.
*  **Fusion** – feeds Openmix with performance data from API integrations with various content and service providers to improve response decisions. (more below)
*  **Sonar** – feeds Openmix with the result of Synthetic Monitoring of configured customer sites. (more below)
*  **Platforms** – integrates Radar, Fusion, and Sonar data into a target vehicle for Openmix analysis. (more below)

Openmix includes forms to get started quickly or the ability to craft java scripts. ITM provides various [developer templates](https://developers.cedexis.com/) available in a public GitHub site. Decision parameters are configured in “Openmix Apps”.

Below we see an example Openmix “Throughput” App that returns 1 of 2 possible [Fully Qualified Domain Names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name). If selected as the optimal response after evaluating the criteria configured for the two respective Platforms (more below).

*  If analysis determines that “fast site” is the optimal Platform, then Openmix responds with the FQDN fast.workspacedemo.net
*  If analysis determines that “slow site” is the optimal Platform, then Openmix responds with the FQDN slow.workspacedemo.net

You can also see in the “Description” quadrant a [Canonical Name]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record) record which [Address records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types) (A) records in a customer’s Authoritative NS maps to. If ITM Predictive DNS is used as the Authoritative DNS it can have an OPENMIX record that maps directly to the app name “ITM Throughput”.

![Openmix throughput app](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizef9.png)

![Predictive DNS](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizeg10.png)
 [Predictive DNS](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/predictive-dns.html) provides Authoritative DNS. It includes all standard record types (A, MX, CNAME, and so forth) and a unique OPENMIX record. This DNS maps a simple tag to an Openmix app to obtain intelligent DNS response decisions. Hosted in Citrix Cloud it includes nearly 100 Global NSs available to provide a response nearest to the source of the DNS query.

Below we see easy to use menus within the ITM console to add Zones and Records.

![Predictive DNS Records](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizeh11.png)

![Fusion](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizei12.png)
[Fusion](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/fusion.html) provides API integrations to third party data feeds with performance data for other internet services, providers, and clouds to enrich ITM's own data sources.

Below we see on an overlay create a Fusion data feed to Citrix NetScaler (now Citrix ADC - currently in Beta). In the overlay to the left of it we see performance data being pulled from the Citrix ADC via its [NITRO API]( /en-us/netscaler/12/nitro-api.html) and the result of the query for the stat for Virtual Server health “vslbhealth” highlighted. The Citrix ADC Virtual Server is the entity used to load balance services that map to actual services. As a result of indicating only half of them, Openmix can make a decision.
![Fusion and Citrix ADC](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizej13.png)

Below we see an Openmix record with the overlays used to create it that import a java script that utilizes the “vslbhealth” data.

![Fusion and Openmix script](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizek14.png)

![Platforms](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizel15.png)
 [Platforms](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/platforms.html) are destination provider sites that can be monitored. They are generally at or near the location where target ITM customer sites are hosted or cloud sites where target content is hosted. Platforms are used as the vehicle to aggregate data to based used by Openmix apps for analysis.

Get started in the ITM console by creating a Platform manually with quick start forms. Use either a public IP address or select from the list of nearly 100 public community platforms. Below we see custom images configured for Radar to download to gather site performance data, Sonar polling toggled to enable, and a custom URL to test.

![Platforms settings](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizem16.png)

Platform entries can be created by importing the GSLB sites from a Citrix ADC configuration or via the Citrix ADM service. Below we see an image of the **Platform** menu for importing an ADC config superimposed over the resulting map. This map is showing average global response times (covered more in the upcoming ITM Visualizer section) to the 2 imported GSLB sites selected (GSLB_east and GSLB_west):

![Platforms and Citrix ADC](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizen17.png)

![Sonar](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizeo18.png)
 [Sonar](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/sonar.html) provides “[Synthetic Monitoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_monitoring)” of websites and other internet services. It is possible by making HTTP or HTTPS requests from multiple points-of-presence (POPs) around the world to a URL that you specify. It is the first criteria in the site selection decision workflow by Openmix Apps.

![Openmix decision workflow](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_optimizep19.png)

## ITM and Navigating the Internet

The backbone of the internet is based on a web of Autonomous Systems (AS) that typically map to an ISP, CDN, or Cloud network. Each provider manages their network of routers and switches to deliver traffic efficiently to the endpoints they host represented by a range of IP addresses within their AS.

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is used by providers to announce the routes they host within their AS and to figure out the shortest path of ASes to reach each respective internet destination requested. While there are other factors providers can implement in BGP to affect path preference, the shortest AS path is, by default, the primary factor used to determine the way an AS routes traffic. This method has served the internet well in managing the navigation of hundreds of thousands of networks available globally. However, it lacks the granularity to route based on factors that affect performance like Quality of Service (QOS) or congestion.

The ITM Radar service utilizes the users of its customer’s websites to gather billions of performance measurements daily from each ISP, CDN, or Cloud provider AS. ITM analyzes this data and responds to its user’s DNS queries with the public IP address of the site which will give them the best performance from the AS their queries originate from.

In the diagram below, we see that after a user in their corporate office makes their first DNS query for a Citrix ITM customer website it receives a response of “1.1.1.1” as the public IP address. Then its HTTP traffic to GET the initial page is routed to Site A (**shown by the RED dotted line**). As part of the initial page load a “Radar” tag is executed and a Java Script file is downloaded. It communicates with the ITM service to obtain a set of instructions regarding what types of queries it should make to that particularly Citrix ITM customer websites and a limited set of other sites where public ITM agents are hosted.

If for example, an Openmix Throughput app was configured, the Java Script would be instructed to download an identical size image from both Site A and Site B (**shown by the dotted ORANGE lines**) from which it would then extrapolate the respective throughput. Then, although Site B can have a longer “path” in the eyes of BGP and even have a longer Round-Trip Delay (RTD) from the office, ITM returns “2.2.2.2” on subsequent queries since it calculates a better bandwidth available. This bandwidth is a result of the congestion in the path from the Office to Site A. The office endpoint’s HTTP traffic to GET the initial page would be routed to Site B (**shown by the GREEN dotted line**)

![Navigating the Internet](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_insertb20.png)

This capability is a differentiator for Citrix ITM, that other DNS, or Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) systems do not provide, thanks to the unique knowledge of the user’s perspective from the Radar RUM database.

## ITM Visualization

Visualizer provides a global heat map of average request durations for global traffic based on private or public community radar measurements. The private measurements are available to individual customers through their ITM service account via Citrix Cloud. Community measurements are also available in the ITM service console or through the public site [Citrix ITM Performance Visualizer]( https://itm.cloud.com/performance) which utilizes a massive set of daily measurements:

*  ~10 billion daily ITM performance measurements
*  ~42,000 daily global networks measured
*  ~242 daily countries measured

It provides a global view of Internet Performance that is based on average user measurements of the complete time from the initial attempt to navigate to a webpage until the first byte is received. This measurement is referred as “Average Request Direction for Global Traffic”, which comprises of 3 sets of times:

*  **DNS** – the client queries the primary NS to determine the IP address of the site. This duration consists of the time for the endpoint client to receive a response to that initial query, which includes the collective time for any recursive queries.
*  **TCP** – once the client has the public IP address, it tries to establish a TCP session to transport the HTTP traffic. The time required to establish a TCP session includes, at a minimum, a SYN to the server, an ACK back to the client, followed by a SYN+ACK back to the server to complete session setup.
*  **Response** – the client browser performs an HTTP GET to the website page, resulting in the client downloading the contents while recording the Time to first byte (TTFB). TTFB is a standard measurement in most current browsers, indicating the duration between the client’s initial GET to the first byte of the page being received by the browser.

![Average Request Direction for Global Traffic](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_visualizea21.png)

To use the community map, customers can select their public ISP, CDN, or Cloud provider from a drop-down list of sites where ITM agents are hosted. Then global performance for selected sites, or points selected directly on the map, can be compared and contrasted against alternative DNS response methods:

*  **Round Robin** – is a common default method for DNS systems which responds by rotating through its list of public IP addresses mapped to a record in circular fashion. It provides some redundancy, but results in random and poor performance.
*  **Geo Proximity** – is a common method for GSLB systems that responds with the public IP of the closet site by identifying the approximate location of the local DNS querier through a static global database of IP addresses or through a dynamic ping.
*  **ITM Optimized** – analyzes a broad set of data. This includes: Radar community measurements, Fusion API extracted input, or Sonar Synthetic monitoring to calculate the most “Intelligent” response based on selection criteria such as RTD, bandwidth, or cost.

Below we see a comparison of 4 AWS sites that use Geographic Proximity for their DNS response method alongside a set of 3 sites that use, radar based, ITM for DNS responses. We can see that there’s a 13% increased performance benefit by using ITM albeit with only 3 sites instead of 4.

The AWS sites chosen are from among nearly 100 public sites available where Citrix ITM agents are hosted. Alternatively, customers can enter public IP addresses of their On-Premises or Private Cloud hosted sites, or click a point on the map they would like to measure.

## ITM Use Cases

ITM can solve many Citrix Workspace customer internet service delivery challenges with these key Use Cases:

*  **Intelligent DNS** – ITM Predictive DNS, hosted by Citrix, provides optimal reliability and response times globally.
*  **Intelligent Traffic** – ITM Openmix responds with the ideal customer hosted website.
*  **Intelligent Cloud** – ITM Visualizer helps customers strategically identify their optimal cloud service providers.
*  **Workspace Intellignece** – ITM directs Citrix Workspace users to the nearest global pop for the best user experience.

### Intelligent DNS

Citrix ITM Predictive DNS can be a benefit to any Citrix customer with internet applications and services, yet there are two scenarios where it clearly provides value:

1.  Customers that currently host their own authoritative DNS On-Premises and are preparing or have begun moving services to the cloud. They would immediately enjoy globally high availability, performance improvement resulting in better user experiences, and all costs and operational benefits of Citrix managing it.
2.  Customers who use hosted DNS in the cloud with load balancing services are limited to Round Robin or GSLB. They would benefit from the performance improvements and reduced cost from ITM’s sophisticated traffic steering capabilities. They would also enjoy the benefits of Citrix Global managed service.

Nearly 100 authoritative NSs around the world support ITM Predictive DNS. This support provides Enterprises with a global reach of authoritative DNS servers that are close to user queries from anywhere in the world and the ability to respond to them. It also includes all of the benefits of having Citrix manage their DNS service such as operational management, scalability, reliability.
To get started with Predictive DNS import your zone file or manually create your pertinent records. Then migrate the Start of Authority for your domain/(s), or subdomain/(s) to ITM NSs.

*  ns1.cedexis.net
*  ns2.cedexis.net
*  ns3.cedexis.net
*  ns4.cedexis.net

Below see an example of Start of Authority (SOA) changed from GoDaddy.com to Citrix ITM for the domain workspacedemo.net

![Changing GoDaddy.com domain SOA](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_usecasesa24.png)

### Intelligent Traffic

Citrix ITM advanced steering capabilities powered by Openmix can be a benefit to any Citrix customer with internet applications and services. There are two scenarios where it most clearly provides value:

1.  Citrix ADC customers using GSLB
2.  Customers must improve performance for their internet applications or services to other markets or countries. However, they are unable to add another Cloud POP or CDN due to cost, red tape, or implementation time and complexity.

Openmix incorporates Radar community data, Sonar Synthetic Monitoring, Fusion API gathered metrics and uses a robust [decision workflow](/en-us/citrix-intelligent-traffic-management/media/openmix-sample-workflow.png) to analyze and decide the most “intelligent” response. Each Openmix app has a CNAME that can be referenced directly by an authoritative NS or they can be easily referenced with their app name with Predictive DNS.

Radar provides a performance report that can be filtered by type and statistics, in addition to the source, include specific platforms, locations, or resources. Below is a graph of the throughput calculations to a private community site, which would support the decision of an Openmix throughput app to respond with the faster site indicated by the top blue line. The blue line on the top of the graph represents the throughput ITM calculates based on Radar measurements for the website fastsite.workspacedemo.net. The orange line toward the bottom of the graph represents the throughput ITM calculates for the mirror website slowsite.workspacedemo.net. Fast site and slow site are identical webpages, yet slow site has a WAN emulator in front of it that reduces bandwidth simulating internet congestion.

![Intelligent Traffic and Internet congestion detection](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_usecasesb25.png)

Therefore, if for example an FQDN of www.workspacedemo.com was mapped to an Openmix Throughput app, using these sites, based on this data it would direct traffic to the fast site as long as the bandwidth calculation to it remained higher than a slow site. This particular type of performance measurement is a capability to avoid internet congestion between the client and server which differentiates ITM capabilities from traditional DNS or GSLB systems.

### Intelligent Cloud

Citrix ITM Visualizer can also be a benefit to any Citrix customer with internet applications and services. There are two scenarios where it clearly provides value:

1.  **Cloud Strategy** - ITM Visualizer can help Citrix customers plan their move to the cloud or optimize their current footprint. Customers can enter their current sites and or alternative sites they are considering as part of planning exercises. ITM can provide great detail on the performance they can expect to their target markets such as ASNs, countries, or continents.
2.  **Network Operations** - the Visualizer functionality included with the ITM service, shown below, also includes various operation alerts and reports that can serve as a valuable asset in a Network Operations Center. Get started with Visualizer by requesting an ITM trial in [Citrix Cloud](https://onboarding.cloud.com/).

![Visualizer and Network Operations](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_usecasesc26.png)

### Workspace Intelligence

This use case is benefit built-in to Citrix Workspace. Customers that implement Citrix Workspace services utilizing Citrix Gateway such SaaS, Web, or Virtual Apps and Desktops, benefit from the power of Citrix ITM and its Intelligent Traffic Management capabilities to direct endpoints to the optimal POP from among the dozens hosted globally. You can recognize this by performing a Nslookup or Dig to obtain the SOA for Gateway hosts which is Citrix Predictive DNS.

![Nslookup and Dig](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_usecasesd27.png)

1.  If we look into the text contents of an ICA file behind the launch of Citrix Virtual App or Desktop from Citrix Workspace we see an entry for “SSLProxyHost=global.g.nssvc.net:443”.

*  SSLProxyHost indicates the Gateway that will proxy the virtual session to the Virtual Delivery Agent.
*  global.g.nssvc.net indicates the FQDN that maps to Citrix Gateway POPs.

Below in the image below on the left we see the results of a Nslookup for the Start of Authority (SOA) for global.g.nssvc.net indicating that Citrix ITM (formerly Cedexis) is in fact the Authoritative NS.
2.  If we launch a SaaS app through Citrix Workspace via a browser and look at the URI, we also notice an FQDN. For example, in the image below on the right we see the results of a Nslookup for the Start of Authority (SOA) for az-us-e.app.netscalergateway.net indicating that Citrix ITM (formerly Cedexis) is also the Authoritative NS.

![Nslookup Workspace FQDNs SOA](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_usecasese28.png)

## ITM and Citrix ADC

Citrix ADC GSLB has been a long-standing pillar of reliability in the business continuity operation of thousands of Citrix customers for many years. Citrix ADCs utilize GSLB site entities to communicate service state information through the Metric Exchange Protocol (MEP). MEP is used to ensure they have the same metrics to make the same decision for each client as to which site to steer Clients to. It also hosts Authoritative DNS (ADNS) to respond to queries for the subdomains with services hosted behind a Citrix ADC Virtual Server, that proxies’ access to the target services, with the public IP address for its “BEST available” option based on the methods implemented. [Citrix ADC GSLB Methods]( /en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/global-server-load-balancing/methods.html) include:

*  **Algorithm based** – uses traditional load balancing methods, like least connected, or least response time, to select the “best” Virtual Server IP address to response to the query.
*  **Static Proximity** – determines the closest site depending on the proximity of the clients local DNS (LDNS) server by utilizing a global database maintained by [IANA]( https://www.iana.org/) which maps public IP network allocations globally.
*  **Dynamic Proximity (RTT)** – measures the time delay in the network between the clients LDNS and a data resource to select the “best” Virtual Server IP address to response to the query.

In the diagram below, we see an example scenario:

1.  Site A has the least connections, communicated between both sites via MEP, therefore it would be selected by GSLB as the **BEST** site option if the algorithm was implemented as the primary selection method
2.  Site B has the closet proximity to the clients local DNS server that made the query, therefore it would be selected by GSLB as the **BEST** site option if Proximity was implemented as the primary selection method

![ITM and Citrix ADC](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/tech-briefs_itm_insertd29.png)

Citrix ITM brings a new aspect of visibility to GSLB environments based on its unique visibility of site performance directly from user’s perspective. ITM can import GSLB site addresses from a ns.conf configuration or directly from Citrix ADM. The site addresses, represented as a platform object in ITM, can be selected to view average global performance in Visualizer or as the source for Openmix decisions apps.
ITM Fusion can also integrate with Citrix ADCs via their NITRO APIs. Then Openmix script-based apps can draw upon Citrix ADC visibility into availability metrics such as least connected or least response time which allows ITM to make an even better DNS response decision.
