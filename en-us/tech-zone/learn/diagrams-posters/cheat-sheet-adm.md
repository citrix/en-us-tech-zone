# Citrix Application Delivery Management (ADM) Overview Cheat Sheet

## Overview

Citrix Application Delivery Management (ADM) is the only application delivery management platform that provides comprehensive automation, faster troubleshooting, and actionable insights. This capability happens all from a single pane of glass for all your application delivery controller (ADC) infrastructure across hybrid multi-cloud environments.

The Citrix ADM Overview Cheat Sheet provides a one-page summary of the ADM Platform detailing system requirements, deployment modes, protocols & ports, common log files, common issues/failures, and more. This sheet does not cover configuring ADM or ADC instances - it is focused on the underlying components of the ADM appliance itself.
