# Diagrams and Poster: Citrix ADC - SDX Basics and Log File Cheat Sheet

## Overview

The Citrix ADC SDX appliance is a multitenant platform on which you can provision and manage multiple virtual Citrix ADC machines (instances). The Citrix ADC offers this capability without the typical loss in cryptographic performance. The SDX provides flexible multitenancy allowing service providers to fully isolate instances. Furthermore, administrators can separate instances based on the network security level, or business unit.

This cheat sheet provides Citrix ADC SDX Basics and Common Log Files. Quickly learn the SDX components and how to access them, common SVM ports, LOM configuration, Link Aggregation, and Common Log files for both SVM and Citrix Hypervisor - all in a one-page cheat sheet.
