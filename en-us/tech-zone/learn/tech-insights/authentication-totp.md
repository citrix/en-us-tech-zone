# Authentication - Time-based one-time password (TOTP)

Citrix Workspace provides a cloud-hosted [Time-based One-Time Password](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/tech-briefs/workspace-identity.html#active-directory-with-totp) (TOTP) option for organizations using a Windows Active Directory as the primary identity. The TOTP micro-service adds multifactor authentication to the user's Workspace experience, enabling the following:

-  Users are able to request and install a new token using Citrix SSO, Microsoft Authentication (and more)
-  Admins can enable TOTP multifactor authentication with minimal effort
-  Admins can easily disable a user's token
