description: Utilize a SAML provider as the user's primary identity for Citrix Workspace
---
# Authentication - SAML

Citrix Workspace provides organizations with a choice in selecting their primary identity provider (IdP). With the integration of SAML, an organization can use a SAML-based identity provider like OneLogin, Ping and SecureAuth as examples.

The user's SAML identity provides them with authorization to access apps, desktops and content within Citrix Workspace. The Citrix Workspace and SAML IdP integration provides the following:

-  Simplify the user experience by relying on a single identity
-  Authorize access to SaaS, Web and virtual apps/desktops based on the user's SAML identity and SAML group membership
-  Integrate a wide-range of SAML-based multi-factor (MFA) capabilities into the user's primary authentication
