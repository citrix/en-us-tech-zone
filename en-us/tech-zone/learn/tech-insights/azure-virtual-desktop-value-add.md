# Tech Insight: Citrix Value Adds to Azure Virtual Desktop

Azure Virtual Desktop offers numerous advantages for [supporting the modern hybrid workforce](https://www.citrix.com/global-partners/microsoft/resources/virtual-desktop-infrastructure-on-azure-e-book.html). Microsoft's desktop as a service (DaaS) offering allows organizations to securely deliver virtual apps and desktops from the Azure cloud. This makes Azure Virtual Desktop a great option for organizations that want to [modernize IT](https://www.citrix.com/global-partners/microsoft/azure-virtual-desktop.html) and reduce capital expenditures.

However, the benefits don't end there.

By deploying [Azure Virtual Desktop with Citrix](https://www.citrix.com/global-partners/microsoft/resources/windows-virtual-desktop-wvd.html), your business can add even more value to the platform. In this video, you get a behind-the-scenes look at exclusive features such as:

*  **Unified management for hybrid multi-cloud:** Only Citrix offers the flexibility to deliver virtual apps and desktops from the cloud of your choice, and manage them right alongside on-premises workloads within one single location.

*  **Support for multimedia and graphics:** Advanced browser viewport offload technology allows you to provide superior delivery of videos and graphics. Users experience smooth playback and great frame rates on both Windows and Linux endpoints.

*  **All-in-one monitoring:** Rather than relying on third-party vendors for monitoring and analytics, Citrix customers have everything needed. Session details, availability reports, login breakdowns, and even performance and security analytics are all accessible in one place.

There's also Citrix Autoscale to [unlock cost savings](https://www.citrix.com/products/citrix-virtual-apps-and-desktops/resources/windows-virtual-desktop-calculator.html), Workspace Environment Management to reduce help desk calls, and Service Continuity to boost resiliency — plus broad support for optimizing Microsoft Teams in a virtual environment.
