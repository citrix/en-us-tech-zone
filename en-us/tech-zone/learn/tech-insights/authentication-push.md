# Authentication - Push

Incorporating a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) into the authentication policy is an easy way to improve authentication security. Extending TOTP to include push authentication allows organizations to provide a better user experience by eliminating the need to manually enter the temporary token. The following Tech Insight video demonstrates how to:

-  Extend an on-premises Citrix Gateway with push authentication
-  Utilize an API from services within Citrix Cloud
-  Simplify user authentication

Once push authentication is configured, organizations can use the on-premises Citrix Gateway with their Citrix Workspace environment by using an OAuth IdP policy, as explained in this [Tech Insight](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/tech-insights/gateway-idp.html) video.
