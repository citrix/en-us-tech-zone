Citrix HDX (High Definition eXperience) is a set of technologies that ensure an unparalleled user experience when connecting to a remote Citrix resource.
With the HDX engine in the Citrix Workspace App and the HDX protocol, Citrix HDX lets users interact seamlessly with resources even in challenging network conditions using

•  Display encoding and image compression technologies which can be applied granularly as policies

•  Adaptive technologies that actively monitor present network conditions to best utilize the available connection while being transparent to the user and no touch for the admin
