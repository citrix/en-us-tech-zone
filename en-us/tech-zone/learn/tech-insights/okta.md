# Tech Insight: Authentication - Okta

Citrix Workspace provides organizations with a choice in selecting their primary identity provider. With the integration of Okta, the user's Okta identity provides them with authorization to access apps, desktops and content within Citrix Workspace. The Citrix Workspace and Okta integration provides the following:

-  Simplify the user experience by relying on a single identity
-  Authorize access to SaaS and Web apps based on the user's Okta identity and Okta group membership
-  Integrate a wide-range of Okta-based multi-factor (MFA) capabilities into the user's primary authentication
