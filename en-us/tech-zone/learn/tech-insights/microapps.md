# Microapps Overview

Citrix introduces intelligent features to the workspace which extend its capabilities by adding machine learning-fueled microapps. Microapps provide users with a streamlined workflow by unbundling applications to provide the end user with simple actions right within their feed. Microapps utilize APIs available within SaaS, web, or home-grown applications allowing users to see content without needing the full launch of the application. Microapps enhance and improve end-user productivity.
