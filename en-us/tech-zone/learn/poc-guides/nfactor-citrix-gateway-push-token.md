# Proof of Concept Guide: nFactor for Citrix Gateway Authentication with Push Token

## Introduction

Time Based One Time Passwords (TOTP) are an increasingly common method to provide an authentication that can increase security posture with other factors. TOTP with PUSH takes advantage of mobile devices by allowing users to receive and accept authentication validation requests at their fingertips. The exchange is secured by applying a hash to a shared key, distributed during setup.

Citrix Gateway supports push notifications for OTP and, can provide authentication for various services including web services, VPN, and Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops. In this POC Guide we demonstrate using it for authentication in a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to implement a Proof of Concept environment using two factor authentication with Citrix Gateway. It uses LDAP to validate Active Directory credentials as the first factor and use Citrix Cloud Push Authentication as the second factor. It uses a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops published virtual desktop to validate connectivity.

It makes assumptions about the completed installation and configuration of the following components:

*  Citrix Gateway installed, licensed, and configure with an externally reachable virtual server bound to a wildcard certificate.
*  Citrix Gateway integrated with a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment which uses LDAP for authentication
*  Citrix Cloud account established
*  Endpoint with Citrix Workspace app installed
*  Mobile device with Citrix SSO app installed
*  Active Directory (AD) is available in the environment

Refer to Citrix Documentation for the latest product version and license requirements. [PUSH Authentication](/en-us/citrix-gateway/13/push-notification-otp.html)

## Citrix Gateway

### nFactor

1.  Log in to the Citrix ADC UI
1.  Navigate to **Traffic Management > SSL> Certificates > All Certificates** to verify you have your domain certificate installed. In this POC example we used a wildcard certificate corresponding to our Active Directory domain. See [Citrix ADC SSL certificates](/en-us/citrix-adc/13/ssl/ssl-certificates.html) for more information.

### Push service action

1.  Next navigate to `Security > AAA - Application Traffic > Policies > Authentication > Advanced Policies > Actions > Push service`
1.  Select Add
1.  Populate the following fields and click OK:
![PUSH Authentication](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-push-token_pushserviceaction.png)
    *  Name - a unique value.
**We will enter values in the following fields to integrate with Citrix Cloud - PUSH Service**
    *  Log in to Citrix Cloud and navigate to **Identity and Access Management > API Access**
    *  Create a unique name for the push service and select create client
**Now we will copy and paste these values to our Citrix ADC policy to integrate with Citrix Cloud - PUSH Service**
![PUSH Authentication](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-push-token_ccidandsecretpopup.png)
    *  Client ID - copy & paste the Client ID from the Citrix Cloud ID and secret popup

## Summary

With Citrix Workspace and Citrix Gateway Enterprises can improve their security posture by implementing multifactor authentication without making the user experience complex. Users can get access to all of their Workspaces resources by entering their standard domain user and password and simply confirming their identity with the push off a button in the Citrix SSO app on their mobile device.
