   ![Citrix SIA Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_3.png)

### Configure the Citrix Secure Internet Access PAC Settings

1.  From the **Configuration** tab navigate to **Locations & Geomapping**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PAC Configuration](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_4.png)
2.  On the **Zones** tab click **Edit Default Zone**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PAC EDIT](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_5.png)
3.  Click **PAC Settings**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PAC SETTINGS](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_6.png)
4.  If you must bypass a domain, use the **Add a Function**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PAC ADD A FUNTION](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_7.png)
5.  These are the recommended Citrix Domain and Subdomains to be added to the PAC File:  
⋅ cloud.com & \*.cloud.com  
⋅ citrixdata.com &*.citrixdata.com  
⋅ citrixworkspaceapi.net & \*.citrixworkspaceapi.net  
⋅ citrixworkspacesapi.net & \*.citrixworkspacesapi.net  
⋅ citrixnetworkapi.net & \*.citrixnetworkapi.net  
⋅ nssvc.net & \*.nssvc.net  
⋅ xendesktop.net & \*.xendesktop.net  
⋅ cloudapp.net & \*.cloudapp.net  
⋅ netscalergateway.net & \*.netscalergateway.net  
6.  Note the node shown "**node-clusterxxxxxx-swg.ibosscloud.com:80**". This must match the customer’s SWG node in Node Collection Management  
   ![Citrix SIA PAC NODE SHOWN](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_8.png)

### Interfacing CSIA Security Groups with Groups from Domain Integration

Users connecting to Citrix Secure Internet Access (CSIA) communicates domain OU information if it is available from their current user login and device. The CSIA cloud platform can be used to match the groups provided by domain-controlled user accounts. Correlating the groups of your domain integration with the security groups contained on the CSIA cloud platform allows you to administer policies and restrictions in a manner similar to the existing security policies within your organization.

The strategy for integrating domain group information into the CSIA cloud platform is to edit security groups to match the aliases of domain groups reported to the platform.

#### Integration Example

To demonstrate the execution of this concept, let's map the domain credentials of a Windows user into a security group on the CSIA cloud platform.

1.  Open a command prompt on the target computer, and run the command "net user (user name) /domain"  
2.  Gather the aliases of groups reported back by the domain controller.  
   ![Citrix SIA AD ALIASES OR GROUPS](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_9.png)
3.  Go to the CSIA cloud platform and edit either the **Group Name** or the **Alias Name** to correspond to one of the groups reported by the domain user.  
   ![Citrix SIA AD ADD ALIAS OR GROUP](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_10.png)
4.  Now when users from the integrated domain group authenticate to the CSIA cloud platform, they are assigned automatically to their corresponding security group.

### Configuring the Proxy settings of the CSIA cloud platform

1.  Navigate to the **Proxy & Caching** module.  
   ![Citrix SIA PROXY & CACHING](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_11.png)
2.  Set **Enable Proxy Settings** to **YES**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PROXY & CACHING ENABLE](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_12.png)
3.  Set **User Authentication Method** to **Local User Credentials + Cloud Connections**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PROXY & CACHING AUTH](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_13.png)
4.  Click **Save**.  
   ![Citrix SIA PROXY & CACHING SAVE](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_14.png)

## Configure Web Security Policies

In this section we focus on the configuration of CSIA Web Security Policies within the administration console. This is the main place where we set actions on web categories.

### Applying Policies to Security Groups

1.  Navigate to the **Web Security** module.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_15.png)
2.  For web security policies that have a group-based implementation available a drop-down menu presents at the top of the page above the configuration form for the policy. The status of this drop-down menu indicates which group's policy configuration you are currently viewing.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY GROUP](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_16.png)
3.  Click the **Group** drop-down menu and then **select group** that you want to reconfigure for the current web security policy.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY GROUP 2](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_17.png)
4.  Clicking **Save**, saves the current policy's configuration only to the currently selected security group from the **Group** drop-down menu.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY GROUP SAVE](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_18.png)
   ⋅ **_Note:_ If you are looking to apply these settings to multiple groups**  
5.  **(Optional)** Click **Save to Multiple Groups** opens a window that allows you to assign the current policy's configuration to multiple security groups simultaneously.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY MULTI GROUP](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_19.png)
6.  Click the **corresponding check box** for any security group you want to apply the current policy configuration.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY MULTI GROUP 2](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_20.png)
7.  Click **Add** to add the selected security groups to the configure group.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY MULTI GROUP ADD](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_21.png)
Groups can either be reconfigured to accept only configuration changes that have currently been applied or accept and overwrite all configuration settings for the current policy.  
8.  The default selection is **Apply Changed Settings** which applies changes you have configured. Select to overwrite all configured settings for the designated security groups.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY MULTI GROUP APPLY](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_22.png)
9.  Individual groups can be removed by clicking **Remove** or **remove all groups** selected for configuration by clicking **Remove All**. Click **Save** to confirm the configuration being applied to all designated security groups.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB SECURITY MULTI GROUP SAVE](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_23.png)

### Web Categories

Domains are tagged with web categories based on their content. The categories of visited websites are recorded in Reporting & Analytics.

#### Category Actions

You can associate actions with web categories. This enables you to deploy security policies quickly while minimizing the need to allow or block individual URLs. Possible actions include Allow, Block, Stealth, Soft Override, or SSL Decryption Enabled.

1.  Each category can have actions that are applied independently from the other categories.

    | Action  | Description  |
    |--- |--- |
    | Allow  | Allows users to access sites of this category. Allow is the default state for all categories. |
    | Block  | Blocks access to sites of a particular category. |
    | Stealth  | Flags traffic to that category as violations in the logs but still allows access to the site.  |
    | Soft Override  | Presents a block page to the user but includes an option to bypass the block temporarily. This allows users to access blocked content without requiring immediate administrator intervention. Soft overrides last until the next day at 2:00 AM in the time zone configured for the gateway. Any block page presented with a soft override appears in Reporting & Analytics as "soft-blocked." After a user has requested a soft override, any traffic to that URL shows as "allowed" until the override has expired.  |
    | SSL Decryption  | Disable this option to clear SSL Decryption for a specific category. This ensures privacy compliance and concerns with specific categories like Finance or Health. The priority value for this category does NOT apply to this setting. If a site belongs to multiple categories, and any of those categories has the "SSL Decryption Disabled" option on, that site is not be decrypted.  |
    | Lock  | When a category is locked by the primary administrator into either an Allowed or Blocked state, delegated administrators cannot log in to the web gateway management interface and change the status of that category.  |
    | Category Override  | When you activate a category override, a delegated administrator cannot log in to the web gateway management interface and add a URL to the allow list that would contradict the rule for this category. For example, the "Art" category is blocked and set to "Overrides," so delegated administrators cannot add art.com to the Allow List for that group.  |

2.  Click each icon to toggle the action for the respective web category.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB CAT 1](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_24.png)
   ![Citrix SIA WEB CAT 2](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_25.png)
   ![Citrix SIA WEB CAT 3](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_26.png)

3.  Actions that you want to generally apply to all web categories can be implemented with the Actions drop-down menu.  
   ![Citrix SIA WEB CAT 1](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_27.png)  
**NOTE:** _Be careful with the “Not Rated” category, as it matches against many sites that are not categorized_

#### Category Priorities

If a domain is associated with multiple categories, the action is determined by comparing the priority values for the categories. Categories with higher priority value take precedence.

Example:

1.  A domain is categorized as both government and hacking. In the web categories configuration, the government is allowed with a weight of 100 while hacking is blocked with a weight of 200.
   ![Citrix SIA EXAMPLE 1](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_28.png)
2.  This domain would be blocked when visited by a user due to the block action of the hacking web category possessing a higher priority value.
3.  Click the priority value field and enter a numerical value to reconfigure a category's priority level. The priority value has a configurable range of 0-65535.

#### Additional Settings

Settings relevant to web categories are configured with toggles under **Additional Settings**. Configuring a toggle to **Yes** enables the setting while configuring a toggle to **No** disables the setting. For a full set of descriptions for all available web category settings refer to the following table:

| Feature  | Description  |
|---  |---  |
| Enable Logging  | Enable and disable logging of violation attempts for the current set of blocked website categories. Log reports may be viewed on the CSIA Reports page. The report information includes the date, time, user, website address, and category of the violation.  |
| Enable Stealth Mode  | It allows you to stealthily monitor Internet activity without blocking access to forbidden sites. With both Logging and Stealth Mode enabled, you can monitor Internet web surfing activity by viewing the log reports on the CSIA Reports page while remaining unnoticed by Internet users on the network.  Note: Websites and online applications are not be blocked when the action for the web category is configured to Stealth Mode.  |
| Enable HTTP Scanning on Non-Standard Ports  | If this feature is enabled, CSIA scans for HTTP web requests on non-standard ports.  |
| Allow Legacy HTTP 1.0 Requests  | If this feature is enabled, CSIA allows HTTP 1.0 requests that are missing the "HOST" header. Disabling this feature provides a higher level of Security and makes bypassing the Security more difficult. If this feature is enabled, it may offer more compatibility with older non-HTTP 1.1 compliant software.  |
| Enable ID Theft / IP Address URL Blocking  | Protects against potential identity theft attempts by notifying you when someone is trying to steal your personal information through Internet Phishing. Enabling this feature also blocks users from navigating to websites using IP address URLs.  |
| Enable Blocked Site Override  | Enabling this feature activates a soft override action, allowing users to proceed to the site belonging to a blocked category. When this setting is active, the user is warned that a page is blocked but provides a button to proceed anyway.  |
| Auto Categorize Uncategorized Sites  | When this toggle is switched to Yes, any sites that are not categorized are automatically submitted for categorization. Note: When this toggle is set to Yes, uncategorized sites may be assigned a Web Category of "Informational" or other such designation. This is only in effect while the category is being appropriately categorized. When this switch is set to No, uncategorized are automatically designated as "Not Rated," which is controlled as its own Web Category.  |

#### Category Scheduling

Block events can also be configured on an advanced weekly schedule to allow access during particular times.

1.  Set Category Scheduling to **Allow Selected Categories Using an Advanced Schedule** to enable the scheduling feature. Click **Advanced Scheduling** to begin scheduling blocked categories.  
   ![Citrix SIA CATEGORY SCHEDULING 1](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_29.png)
2.  The current advanced schedule can either be configured to apply to all blocked categories or only to a particular blocked category.  
   ![Citrix SIA CATEGORY SCHEDULING 2](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_30.png)
3.  Each day during the week can be delegated specific periods of time that the category is be allowed. These particular periods of time are indicated by a blue rectangle.  
   ![Citrix SIA CATEGORY SCHEDULING 3](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_31.png)
4.  After finalizing the schedule for a particular category, you can click the category drop-down menu once again and select a new category to configure.
5.  Click **Save** to confirm all schedule configurations.  
   ![Citrix SIA CATEGORY SCHEDULING SAVE](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_32.png)

### Allow List

The allow lists selectively provides access to a specific website or network resource. This feature enables you to override security policies and allow certain users to access a website. In particular, you can use this to grant access to specific URLs for a domain that is otherwise blocked. This is sometimes referred to as "punching a hole."

#### Adding a URL to an Allow List

1.  Navigate to **Web Security Policies**.
2.  On the drop-down menu click **Allow List**.  
   ![Citrix SIA ALLOW LIST](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_33.png)
3.  From above the list section, click **URL/IP Range**.  
   ![Citrix SIA ALLOW LIST URL/IP](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_34.png)
4.  Type a **domain, subdomain, URL, IP address, or IP Range**. This is the only required field, but many other criteria can be specified.
5.  From the right side of the list, click **+Add**. The entry is now added to the list.

#### Scrape Tool

The **Allow List** section includes the handy Scrape Tool. Use this to quickly identify all of the domains that a website uses. In the modern web, many sites use resources from other domains that are not immediately apparent. With the Scrape Tool, these are easily revealed and added to an allow list.

Another use for the Scrape Tool is to selectively only allow portions of a website, while not allowing unwanted content, such as ad servers.

1.  From above the list section, click **Scrape**.  
   ![Citrix SIA SCRAPE TOOL](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_35.png)
2.  Enter the URL to Scrape and click **Scan**.  
   ![Citrix SIA SCRAPE SCAN](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_36.png)
3.  Select domains to add to Allow List and click Add Selected to Allow List.  
   ![Citrix SIA SCRAPE ADD](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_37.png)

### Keyword Block List / Allow List

Keyword filtering is used to inspect URLs for specific words. If a keyword is identified, the content can be allowed or blocked.

#### Adding a URL to a Block List / Allow List

1.  Navigate to **Web Security Policies**.
2.  On the drop-down menu click **Keywords**.  
   ![Citrix SIA KEYWORD](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_38.png)
3.  Enter the **keyword** that you would like to block in the **Keyword** field and specify the designations that apply to this keyword. Click **Add**.  
   ![Citrix SIA KEYWORD ALLOW](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_39.png)

| Option  | Description  |
|---  |----  |
| Allow Keyword  | Checking this option allows the word if it is in the URL within a keyword parameter.  |
| High Risk  | When any words designated as "High Risk" are searched, an email notification is sent to the administrator of the group.  |
| Wildcard Match  | When enabled, keywords are filtered even when they are just substrings of a larger word. For example, a wildcard match for the keyword "base" blocks searches that include "base" or "baseball." Without wildcard matching, it only blocks "base."  |
| Global  | This option spans across all Security groups when selected. When removing a “Global" entry, it removes the entry from all filtering groups. |

#### Pre-defined Keyword Lists

You can enable filtering for pre-defined lists of Adult and High-Risk keywords or add more keywords manually.

The Pre-defined Keyword Lists contain common Adult and High-Risk keywords. Wildcard matching is applied to all keywords in these lists. A wildcard match recognizes the keyword's sequence of characters anywhere in the URL, including the host name. The High-Risk list generates an email to the recipient of alert emails when a High-Risk keyword is detected by the Reporting & Analytics functionality of the CSIA cloud platform.

1.  To enable either one of the keyword lists, set the Adult or High-Risk toggle to **Yes**. Click **Save**.  
   ![Citrix SIA KEYWORD ALLOW](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_secure-internet-access-swa_40.png)

## Troubleshooting

### Important Tools for Troubleshooting

1.  Windows Event Log
2.  CSIA Real-Time Dashboard **(Reporting & Analytics > Real-Time Log)**
3.  CSIA Event Logs **(Reporting & Analytics > Logs > Event Log)**
4.  CSIA IPS Logs **(Reporting & Analytics > Logs > IPS Log)**
5.  Registration Information for Connected Devices **(Users, Groups & Devices > Cloud Connected Device > Info)**
6.  URL Lookup Tool **(Tools > URL Lookup)**
7.  Enhanced Logging  
 ⋅ To set this, the following registry key must be altered, varying from 0 to 4, the higher giving more verbose logging.  
 ⋅  **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\IBoss\IBSA\Parameters\LogLevel**  
⋅ Once the registry key has been set, the IBSA service under Windows Services must be restarted for the setting to take effect. Checking windows event viewer, you see many entries being logged depending on log level set.
8.  Windows Agent Logs (C:\Windows\SysWOW64\ibsa_0.log)

### A Keyword is not Being Blocked

There is a multitude of policies and variables within and surrounding the operations of the CSIA cloud platform that can interfere with properly blocking configured keywords. Refer to the following;

1.  Ensure that SSL decryption is active for this website. Keywords cannot be observed or controlled for HTTPS websites.
2.  If the source IP of the client workstation or the destination IP of the webserver has been added to the **Network > Bypass IP Ranges** list, web security controls are not be enforced.
3.  Keywords configured to block do not take effect if the website is added to the **Web Security > Allow List without the Keyword/Safesearch** option enabled. With the Keyword / SafeSearch check box selected, Web Gateway allows access to the website but still to enforce Keyword controls and Safesearch.
4.  The keyword contains asterisks, instead remove the asterisks and activate Wildcard matching for the keyword if that is the desired effect.
5.  The keyword has multiple words, and Wildcard Matching is not enabled, or the spaces were not indicated with a plus sign ("+").
6.  The user is not associated with the expected web security group that has the keyword control enabled.

### Conflicting Actions from Pre-defined Keyword Lists

In some situations, a word in one of the built-in lists of keywords may inadvertently block content unexpectedly. To correct this action, edit the specific pre-defined keyword list. When you click the pencil icon to edit a built-in list, the CSIA cloud platform interface presents a page of keywords with check boxes next to them. To remove the keyword from the built-in list, clear the box next to the keyword you would like to remove and click **Save**. To apply this action to all groups, check the box that is labeled **Apply to All Groups**.

### Identifying the Customer’s Citrix Secure Internet Access Node
