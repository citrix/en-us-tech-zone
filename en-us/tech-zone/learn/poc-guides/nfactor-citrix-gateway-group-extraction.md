# Proof of Concept Guide: nFactor for Citrix Gateway Authentication with Group Extraction

## Introduction

Large Enterprise environments require flexible authentication options to meet the needs of a variety of user personas. With Group Extraction user AD group membership determines the number, and type of nFactor authentication methods users are required to complete to verify their identity and access their applications and data.

Examples of user groups include:

*  normal-security-group for individuals that may have lower security requirements by the nature of their job or limited data access and are located within the bounds of the corporate security perimeter. This group may only require 1 factor.
*  elevated-security-group for third party workers or contractors who may not have had background checks done and have higher security requirements. This group may require 2 or more factors.
*  high-security-group for employees that perform critical jobs, and require special government clearance, or industry approval. This group may require 2 or more factors and contextual verifications such as source IP address.

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to implement a Proof of Concept environment using two factor authentication with Citrix Gateway. It uses LDAP only to validate Active Directory credentials if the user's endpoint is on a private subnet, indicating they are on the corporate intranet, or if they are a member of a "VIP" AD group such as a CXO. Otherwise, it is assumed they are located external to the perimeter of the Enterprise network and not a member of a group with lower security requirements, and are required to complete a second factor in the form of entering an email One Time Password (OTP). It uses a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops published virtual desktop to validate connectivity.

It makes assumptions about the completed installation and configuration of the following components:

*  Citrix ADC installed, and licensed
*  Citrix Gateway configured with an externally reachable virtual server bound to a wildcard certificate
*  Citrix Gateway integrated with a Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment which uses LDAP for authentication
*  Endpoint with Citrix Workspace app installed
*  Active Directory (AD) is available in the environment
*  Access to an SMTP server to originate email

Refer to Citrix Documentation for the latest product version, and license requirements: [nFactor Group Extraction](/en-us/citrix-adc/current-release/aaa-tm/configure-two-passwords-group-extraction.html)

## nFactor

First, we log in to the CLI on our Citrix ADC and enter the authentication actions and associated policies for LDAP and Email respectively. Then we log in to our GUI to build our nFactor flow in the visualizer tool and complete the multifactor authentication configuration.

### LDAP Authentication policies

We create the LDAP actions, and the policies that reference them. We also create the Email action, and the policy that references it, which is the multifactor authentication method for users that are not members of the VIP group or on a local subnet.

For LDAP Actions populate the required fields to create the LDAP action in a string and paste it into the CLI:

*  `ldapAction` - enter the action name.
*  `serverIP` - enter the domain server/s FQDN or IP address.
*  `serverPort` - enter the LDAP port.
*  `ldapBase` - enter the string of domain objects and containers where pertinent users are stored in your directory.
*  `ldapBindDn` - enter the service account used to query domain users.
*  `ldapBindDnPassword` - enter your service account password.
*  `ldapLoginName` - enter the user object type.
*  `groupAttrName` - enter the group attribute name.
*  `subAttributeName` - enter the sub attribute name.
*  `secType` - enter the security type.
*  `ssoNameAttribute` - enter the single sign-on name attribute.
*  `defaultAuthenticationGroup` - enter the default authentication group.
*  `alternateEmailAttr` - enter the user domain object attribute where their email address can be retrieved.

For LDAP Policies populate the required fields to reference the LDAP Action in a string and paste it into the CLI:

*  `Policy` - enter the policy name.
*  `action` - enter the name of the Email action we created above.

For more information see [LDAP authentication policies](/en-us/citrix-adc/13/aaa-tm/configure-aaa-policies/ns-aaa-setup-policies-authntcn-tsk/ns-aaa-setup-policies-auth-LDAP-tsk.html)

1.  First connect to the CLI by opening an SSH session to the NSIP address of the Citrix ADC and log in as the `nsroot` administrator or equivalent admin user.

`add authentication loginSchema lSchema_GroupExtract_genf -authenticationSchema "/nsconfig/loginschema/LoginSchema/OnlyUsername.xml"`

#### lSchema 2 - CheckAuthType_genf

The second factor does not require a Login Schema. It just has policies with expressions to check which factor to do next.

#### lSchema 3A - lSchema_LDAPPasswordOnly_genf

Update the following fields for your environment and copy and paste the string into the CLI:
`add authentication loginSchema lSchema_LDAPPasswordOnly_genf -authenticationSchema "/nsconfig/loginschema/PrefilUserFromExpr.xml"`
   **Here you may receive a warning that http.req.user has been replaced with aaa.user. You must edit the xml file from the cli.**

![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_httprequserdeprecated.png)

1.  Log in to the Citrix ADC CLI
1.  Enter `shell`
1.  Enter `cd /nsconfig/loginschema/LoginSchema`
1.  Enter 'vi PrefilUserFromExpr.xml'
1.  Enter `/http.req`
1.  Press x 8 times to delete the http.req string
1.  Press the escape key
1.  Press i and enter `aaa`, press the escape key again
1.  Press the colon key ':', enter `wq` and press enter.
1.  **NOTE that you can use this method to modify other aspects of the login schema such as the field prompts**

#### lSchema 3B - lSchema_EOTPPasswordOnly_genf

Update the following fields for your environment and copy and paste the string into the CLI:
`add authentication loginSchema lSchema_EOTPPasswordOnly_genf -authenticationSchema "/nsconfig/loginschema/PrefilUserFromExpr.xml"`

NOTE: The 3B factor also uses the PrefilUserFromExpr.xml schema, but we label the policy differently for the EOTP path.

#### lSchema 4B - EOTP_genf

The fourth factor does not require a Login Schema. It generates the email with the One Time Passcode.

### nFactor

1.  Log in to the Citrix ADC GUI
1.  Navigate to **Traffic Management > SSL> Certificates > All Certificates** to verify you have your domain certificate installed.

1.  Click Done

## User Endpoint

First we test whether One Factor authentication is applied to VIP users by authenticating into our Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment.

1.  Open a browser, and navigate to the domain FQDN managed by the Citrix Gateway. We use `https://citrixadc5.workspaces.wwco.net`
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsvipuser-username.png)
1.  After your browser is redirected to a login screen. First enter a user name. We use `wsvipuser@workspaces.wwco.net`
**This user must be a member of the AD group `VIP`**
1.  nFactor determines that the user is a member of the VIP group and you are prompted to submit the user password.
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsvipuser-password.png)
1.  Now the user is logged into their Workspace page.
1.  Select a virtual desktop and verify launch.
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsvipuser-cvad.png)

Now we test Two Factor authentication with Email OTP by authenticating into our Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment again.

1.  Open a browser, and navigate to the domain FQDN managed by the Citrix Gateway. We use `https://citrixadc5.workspaces.wwco.net`
1.  After your browser is redirected to a login screen. First enter a user name. We use `wsuser@workspaces.wwco.net`
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsuser-username.png)
1.  nFactor determines that the user is not local, nor a member of the VIP group, you are be prompted to submit the user password.
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsuser-password.png)
1.  The nFactor then presents a form requesting the OTP passcode. We copy and paste the passcode from the `wsuser` email account.
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsuser-otp.png)
1.  Now the user is logged into their Workspace page.
1.  Select a virtual desktop and verify launch.
![Group Extraction](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_nfactor-citrix-gateway-group-extraction_wsuser-cvad.png)

## Summary

With Citrix Workspace and Citrix Gateway Enterprises can improve their security posture by implementing multifactor authentication without making the user experience complex. Group Extraction allows Enterprises to customize the depth of their multifactor use, along with contextual authentication, according to user group persona requirements.
