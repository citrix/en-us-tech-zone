# Proof of Concept Guide: Microsoft Azure Active Directory Federated Authentication for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops with Citrix ADC

## Introduction

Use of the Cloud to deliver Enterprise services continues to grow. Cloud services inherit the benefits built into cloud infrastructure including resiliency, scalability, and global reach. Azure Active Directory (AAD) is the Microsoft Azure hosted directory service and provides those same cloud benefits to Enterprises. AAD allows Enterprises to host their employee identities in the cloud and securely access services also hosted in the Cloud, or on-premises.

Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops delivers virtual apps and desktops using resources hosted on-premises, or in the Cloud. Citrix ADC provides secure remote access to those virtual apps, and desktops and also can be hosted on-premises, or in the Cloud. Together along with the Citrix Federated Authentication Service they can utilize AAD to authenticate user access to Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops from anywhere.

## Overview

The guide demonstrates how to implement a Proof of Concept environment for Microsoft AAD Federated Authentication for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops with Citrix ADC using SAML. AAD acts as the Identity Provider (IdP) while Citrix ADC acts as the Service Provider (SP).

It makes assumptions about the installation, or configuration of certain components:

*  An Active Directory Server is installed on-premises and you can log in as Domain Admin.
*  An Azure tenant is available with a P2 license and you can log in as Global Admin.
*  A Citrix ADC appliance has been installed and licensed. Also it has a Citrix Gateway virtual server configured to provide access to an on-premises Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops environment. Use Version 13 build 60, or higher.
*  A Delivery Controller, StoreFront, and VDA are installed, and configured to delivery virtual apps, or desktops for domain users. Use version 2006, or higher.
*  A virtual machine is available, or another server has enough capacity to install FAS. The DDC, FAS, and StoreFront are all installed on the same server in this POC.
*  The Remote Client is able to launch a virtual app or desktop using the Workspace App, or browser. Use Windows Version 20.6.0.38(2006), or higher.

## AD and AAD Config

To configure Active Directory (AD) and Azure Active Directory (AAD) perform the following steps:

### AD

#### Alternative UserPrincipalName (UPN) Suffix

1.  Log in to your AD domain controller.
1.  Open **Server Manager > Tools > Active Directory Domains and Trusts**
1.  Right-click, select **Properties** and enter the UPN Suffix for users corresponding to one of your AAD domains.
![Alt UPN Suffix](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_000-adalternativeupnsuffix.png)

#### AD Users

1.  On your AD domain controller open **Server Manager > Tools > Active Directory Users and Computers**.
1.  Right-click and select **New > User**, or edit an existing one
1.  **Under Properties > Account set the UPN** to the new Suffix. ![AD User](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_000-aduser.png)

#### Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect

Azure AD Connect is a tool for connecting on-premises identity infrastructure to Microsoft Azure AD. It allows us to copy AD users to AAD with a UserPrincipalName (UPN) mapped to our AAD domain.

1.  Log in to your AD domain controller, or other virtual server where you host the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect process.
2.  Download the executable from the Microsoft download site [Microsoft Azure Active Directory Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594) and launch it.
3.  You are prompted to accept making changes to the virtual machine and accept a license agreement on the welcome page. ![AD Connect](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_000-adconnectwelcome.png)
4.  You are prompted to log in as a Global AAD admin and as a Domain Services admin.
5.  For installation on a single AD virtual machine you can follow express settings. After it verifies UPN Suffixes it makes a full sync of all users, groups, and contacts.

See [using Azure AD Connect express settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-express) for more information.

#### Certificate Authority

For this POC we assume you have a Certificate Authority, including Web Enrollment, installed on an AD DC. If not navigate to **Server Manager > Add roles** and features and follow prompts to install Active Directory Certificate Services. See [Microsoft Certificate Authority Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/install-the-certification-authority) for more information.

1.  Next launch MMC
2.  Select **Add/Remove Snap-in > Certificates > Computer Account > Ok**
3.  Right-click **Personal > All Tasks > Request New Certificate**
4.  Click Next and select Active Directory Enrollment Policy
5.  Select Domain Controller Authentication and click Enroll ![AAD Non-gallery application](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_000-addomaincontrollerauth.png)

## Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Config

To integrate Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops components with FAS perform the following steps:

### StoreFront

#### Enable FAS on StoreFront

*  Open PowerShell as an administrator, and run:
    *  `Get-Module "Citrix.StoreFront.*" -ListAvailable | Import-Module`
    *  `$StoreVirtualPath = "/Citrix/Store"`
    *  `$store = Get-STFStoreService -VirtualPath $StoreVirtualPath
    $auth = Get-STFAuthenticationService -StoreService $store`
    *  `Set-STFClaimsFactoryNames -AuthenticationService $auth -ClaimsFactoryName "FASClaimsFactory"`
    *  `Set-STFStoreLaunchOptions -StoreService $store -VdaLogonDataProvider "FASLogonDataProvider"`

See [Enable the FAS plug-in on StoreFront stores](/en-us/federated-authentication-service/install-configure.html#enable-the-fas-plug-in-on-storefront-stores) for more information.

#### Configure StoreFront for Citrix Gateway

1.  Log in to the StoreFront virtual machine (which also hosts FAS, and the DDC in our POC), and launch the StoreFront GUI
1.  Select Manage Authentication Methods from the menu on the right
1.  Select Pass-through from Citrix Gateway
1.  Select the down arrow next to the gear, and select Configure Delegated Authentication
1.  Check Fully delegate credential validation to Citrix Gateway, and click OK twice ![Create Authentication Profile](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_000-storefrontdelegatedauth.png)
1.  Select Manage Authentication Methods from the menu on the right
1.  Edit the pertinent Citrix Gateway entry
1.  Under Authentication Settings the Callback URL must be configured if it is not done already.

![FAS GPO update](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_0016.png)
    *  h. To verify it's been applied open regedit.exe, and navigate to: /Computer\HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Citrix\Authentication\UserCredentialService\Addresses Address1 entry set to the FQDN applied through the GPO. If it does not appear you may need to reboot the respective virtual machine.
![FAS GPO registry](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_0017.png)
    *  i. Next return to the FAS virtual machine to begin the service installation. (We host FAS, StoreFront, and the DDC on the same VM for the POC. For production you would typically host them on different VMs for improved scalability, and supportability.)
    *  j. Run the Citrix Federated Authentication Service program. Select each of the five steps in sequence, and follow the instructions:
       *  i. Deploy certificate templates
       *  ii. Set up a certificate authority
       *  iii. Authorize this service - for this step return to the CA to issue a pending request. The CA is hosted on the Domain Controller in this POC example.
       *  iv. Create Rule - here specify the CA, and certificate already configured. Also filter the VDAs, and users that are allowed to use the FAS service.
       *  v. (Connect to Citrix Cloud - in this guide we use on-premises Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops)

See [FAS documentation](/en-us/federated-authentication-service.html) for more information.

## Citrix Workspace client validation

To validate the POC perform the following steps:

### Workspace for Web

1.  Open a browser, and navigate to the domain FQDN managed by the Citrix ADC. Notice that the Citrix Gateway redirects to AAD.
1.  Log in with the UPN of a user configured to be part of the FAS environment ![Log in](/en-us/tech-zone/learn/media/poc-guides_cvad-azuread-federation_000-remotewebredirectaaduser.png)
